MEPS HC -224 
2020 Full Year  
Consolidated Data File  
August 202 2 
Due to the COVID- 19 pandemic, changes were made to the 2020 MEPS data 
collection that analysts should keep in mind when doing trend analy sis and 
pooling years of data. 1) The MEPS moved primarily to a phone rather than 
in-person survey. 2) Panels 23 and 24 were extended to nine rounds (four 
years) of data collection as opposed to the historical five rounds (two years).  
Beca use of the unforeseeable nature of the pandemic, data collection for 2020 
included Round 5 interviews for Panel 23 that were fielded under the assumption that that interview would be the panel’s last interview. Researchers using variables related to the first interview of the calendar year should read the documentation for their specific variables to understand the 
sources of the values for Panel 23.

B.  Background  
1.0 Household Component  
The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) provides nationally representative estimates of 
health care use, expenditures, sources of payment, and health insurance coverage for the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population. The MEPS Household Component (HC) also provides estimates of respondents’ health status, demographic and socio- economic characteristics, 
employment, access to care, and satisfaction with health care. Estimates can be produced for individuals, families, and selected population subgroups. The panel design of the survey, which includes 5 Rounds of interviews covering 2 full calendar years and two additional rounds in 2020 covering a third year to compensate for the smaller number of compl eted interviews in Panel 25 , 
provides data for examining person level changes in selected variables such as expenditures, health insurance coverage, and health status. Using computer assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) technology, information about each household member is collected, and the survey builds on this information from interview to interview. All data for a sampled household are reported by a single household respondent. 
The MEPS HC was initiated in 1996. Each year a new panel of sample households is selected. 
Because the data collected are comparable to those from earlier medical expenditure surveys conducted in 1977 and 1987, it is possible to analyze long-term trends. Each annual MEPS HC sample size is about 15,000 households. Data can be analyzed at either the person or event level. Data must be weighted to produce national estimates.  
The set of households selected for each panel of the MEPS HC is a subsample of households 
participating in the previous year’s National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics. The NHIS sampling frame provides a nationally representative sample of the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population. In 2006, the NHIS implemented a new sample design, which included Asian persons in addition to households with Black and Hispanic persons in the oversampling of minority populations. NHIS introduced a new sample design in 2016 that discontinued oversampling of these minority groups.  
2.0 Medical Provider Component  
Upon completion of the household CAPI interview and obtaining permission from the household survey respondents, a sample of medical providers are contacted by telephone to obtain information that household respondents can not accurately provide. This part of the ME PS is 
called the Medical Provider Component (MPC) and information is collected on dates of visits, diagnosis and procedure codes, charges and payments. The Pharmacy Component (PC), a subcomponent of the MPC, does not collect charges or diagnosis and procedure codes but does collect drug detail information, including National Drug Code (NDC) and medicine name, as well as amounts of payment. The MPC is not designed to yield national estimates. It is primarily used as an imputation source to supplement/replace household reported expenditure information.

C.  Technical and Programming Information  
1.0 General Information  
This documentation describes the 2020 full -year consolidated data file from the Medical 
Expenditure Panel Survey Household Component (MEPS HC). Released as an ASCII file (with 
related SAS, Stata, SPSS , and R programming statements and data user information), a SAS data 
set, a SAS transport dataset,  a Stata data set, and an Excel file this public use file provides 
information collected on a nationally representative sample of the civilian noninstitutionalized population of the Uni ted States for calendar year 2020 . The file contains 1,451 variables and has 
a logical record length of 4,154 with an additional 2- byte carriage return/line feed at the end of 
each record.  
This file consists of MEPS survey data obtained in Rounds 6 and 7 of Panel 23; Rounds 3, 4, and 5 of Panel 2 4; an d Rounds 1, 2, and 3 of Panel 25, the rounds for the MEPS panels covering 
calendar year 2020. 2020 is the first data year to include three panels of data; Panel 23 was extended to include Rounds 6 and 7. An overview of the impact of this change on variables and variable names is described in Section 2.4 . 
This file contains variables pertaining to survey administration, demographics, income, person-level conditions, health status, disability days, quality of care, employment, health insurance, and person- level medical care use and expenditures.  
The following documentation offers a brief overview of the types and levels of data provided, content and structure of the files, and programming information. It contains the following sections:  
• Data File Information  
• Survey Sample Information 
• Variable -Source Crosswalk  
Both weighted and unweighted frequencies of most variables included in the 2020 full -year 
consolidated data file are provided in the accompanying codebook file. The exceptions to this are weight variables, variance estimation variables, and variables that have a separate weight (SAQ  
and DCS). Only unweighted frequencies of these variables are included in the accompanying 
codebook file. See the Weights Variables list in Section D, Variable -Source Crosswalk. 
A database of all MEPS products released to date can be fo und on the MEPS website

Survey in 2020. These persons received a positive person- level weight, a family -level weight, or 
both (some participating persons belonged to families characterized as family -level 
nonrespondents while some members of participati ng families were not eligible for a person -
level weight).  
These 27,805 persons were part of one of the three  MEPS panels for whom data were collected 
in 2020: Rounds 6 and 7 of Panel 23; Rounds 3, 4, and 5 of Panel 24; or Rounds 1, 2, and 3 of 
Panel 2 5. Of these persons, 26,847 were assigned a positive person -level weight. There were 
12,290 families receiving a positive family -level weight. The codebook provides both weighted 
and unweighted frequencies for most variables on the dataset. In conjunction with the person-level weight variable (PERWT 20F) provided on this file, data for persons with a positive person-
level weight can be used to make estimates for the civilian noninstitutionalized U.S. population for 2020.  
The MEPS CAPI design has changed significantly beginning with the specifications for Panel 21 
Round 5/Panel 22 Round 3/Panel 23 Round 1. In addition, two rounds of data collection were added for Panel 23 in 2020 (Rounds 6 and 7). The following sections of the CAPI instrument were asked in the ne w rounds:

populating “31” variables.  See Appendix 4 for details.  
2.1 Codebook Structure  
The codebook and data file sequence lists variables in the following order: 
• Unique person identifiers and survey administration variables  
• Geographic variables

2.2 Reserved Codes  
The following reserved code values are used: 
Value  Definition  
-1 INAPPLICABLE  Question was not asked due to skip pattern  
-2 DETERMINED IN 
PREVIOUS ROUND  Question was not asked in round because there was no change in current main job since previous round 
-7 REFUSED  Question was asked and respondent refused to answer question  
-8 DK Question was asked and respondent did not know answer or the information could not be ascertained 
-10 HOURLY WAGE >= $103.36 Hourly wage was top -coded for confidentiality 
-13 INITIAL WAGE IMPUTED  Hourly wage was previously imputed so an updated wage is not included in this file  
-15 CANNOT BE COMPUTED Value cannot be derived from data 
The value -15 (CANNOT BE COMPUTED) is assigned to MEPS constructed variables in cases where there is not enough information from the MEPS instrument to calculate the constructed variables. “ Not enough information” is often the result of skip patterns in the data or from 
missing information resulting from MEPS responses of - 7 (REFUSED) or -8 (DK). N ote that

================================================================================

reserved code -8 includes cases where the information from the question was “not ascertained” 
or where the respondent chose “don’t know”. 
2.3 Codebook Format  
This codebook describes an ASCII data set (although the data are also being provided in a SAS 
data set, SAS transport file, Stata data set, and Excel file) and provides the following 
programming identifiers for each variable:  
Identifier Description  
Name  Variable name  
Description  Variable descriptor  
Format  Number of bytes 
Type  Type of data: numeric (indicated by NUM) or character (indicated by CHAR)  
Start  Beginning column position of variable in record  
End Ending column position of variable in record 
2.4 Variable Naming  
In general, variable names reflect the content of the variable. Edited variables end in an X and are so noted in the variable label. The last two characters in round -specific variables denote the 
rounds of data collection, for example, Round 3, 4, or 5 of Panel 24, and Round 1, 2, or 3 of Panel 2 5. Historically round dates have been indicated by two numbers following the variable 
name; the first number representing the  round for second panel persons (Panel 24), the second 
number representing the round for first panel persons (Panel 25). For example, EMPST31 refers to employment status on the Round 3 interview date for Panel 24 persons and employment status on the Round 1 interview date for Panel 25 persons.  
The variable names in the 2020 files have not been renamed from prior years, despite the 
addition of Rounds 6 and 7 of Panel 23, and those round numbers (6, 7) will not be included in the variable names. The variable names containing “53” (for example, AGE 53X, INS53X, 
INSAT53X, EMPST53, and HELD53X) have data from Round 7 of Panel 23, Round 5 of Panel 24, and Round 3 of Panel 25. The variable names that contain “42” (for example, AGE42X, INS42X, INSAT42X, EMPST42, and HELD42X) have data from Round 6 of Panel 23, Round 4 of Panel 24, and Round 2 of Panel 25.  
The variable names that contain “31” have data from Round 3 of Panel 24 and Round 1 of Panel 
25, but the values from Panel 23 are more complicated. Although the Panel 23 Round 5 interviews were conducted  in 2020, these interviews only collected data for 2019 (questions 
referred to “as of 12/31/2019”). In order to cover 2020, the reference period for Panel 23 Round 6 began January 1, 2020. Hence, the Panel 23 values for the “31” variables were created in one of six ways:  
1. They are copies of the Round 6 values (e.g., AGE31X),  
 C-4 M
 EPS HC -224 


================================================================================
PÁGINA 13
================================================================================

2. They contain -15 because the questions were not asked in the Round 5 and Round 6 
interviews, but the questions were asked in the Panel 24 Round 3 and Panel 25 
Round 1 interviews (e.g., IADLHP31),  
3. They were edited to hold data collected in Round 6 about status as of the Round 5 interview date, so that they are temporally comparable to the values from Panel 24 Round 3 and Panel 25 Round 1 (e.g., INS31X), 
4. They were edited to hold data collected in Round 6 about the period from January 1st through the Round 5 interview date, so that they are temporally comparable to the values from Panel 24 Round 3 and Panel 25 Round 1 (e.g., INSAT31X), 
5. They were edited to hold data collected in Rounds 5 and 6 about the period from the beginning of the Round 5 reference period and ending with the Round 5 interview date, so that they are temporally comparable to the values from Panel 24 Round 3 (e.g., HELD 31X), 
6. They were edited using data collected in other ro unds (Rounds 1- 6) to reflect the 
period between the Round 4 and Round 5 interview dates, so that they are temporally comparable to the values from Panel 24 Round 3 (e.g., HOUR31). 
It is important to note that when “31” variables reflect information from pa rt of Round 6, the 
“42” variables reflect information collected in the Round 6 interview for the time period after the Round 5 interview date (for example, INSAT42X and EMPST42). Particularly for these variables, some users might find it helpful to think of these variables as (6)42 and (7)53, even though the naming convention remains as 31, 42, and 53. See each section of the documentation and Appendix 3 for descriptions of how the “31” and “42” variables were created for Panel 23. 
Beginning in 2018, as var iable collection, universe, or categories are altered, the variable name 
will be appended with “_Myy” to indicate in which year the alterations took place. Details about 
these alterations can be found throughout this document. 
Variables contained in this delivery were derived either from the questionnaire itself or from the 
CAPI. The source of each variable is identified in the section of the documentation entitled “Section D. Variable-Source Crosswalk.” Sources for each variable are indicated in one of four ways: (1) variables derived from CAPI or assigned in sampling are so indicated; (2) variables derived from complex algorithms associated with re- enumeration are labeled “RE Section”; (3) 
variables that are collected by one or more specific questions in the instrument have those question numbers listed in the Source column; and (4) variables constructed from multiple questions using complex algorithms are labeled “Constructed.” 
2.5 File Contents  
Users of MEPS data should be aware that the survey collects d ata for all sample persons who 
were in the survey target population at any time during the survey period. In other words, a small proportion of individuals in MEPS analytic files are not members of the survey target population (i.e., civilian noninstitutionalized) for the entire survey period. These persons include those who 
 C-5 M
 EPS HC -224 


================================================================================
PÁGINA 14
================================================================================

had periods during whic
h they lived in an institution (e.g., nursing home or prison), were in the 
military, or lived out of the country, as well as those who were born (or adopted) into MEPS 
sample households or died during the year. They are considered sample persons for the survey and are included in MEPS data files with positive person weights, but no data were collected for the periods they were not inscope and their annual data for variables like health care utilization, expenditures, and insurance coverage reflect only the part of the year they were inscope for the survey. Persons who are inscope for only part of the year should not be confused with non-respondents. Sample persons w ho are classified as non -respondents to one or more rounds of 
data collection (i.e., initial non -respondents and dropouts over time) are not included in MEPS 
annual files, and survey weights for full- year respondents are inflated through statistical 
adjustment procedures to compensate for both full and part-year nonresponse (see Section 3.0 “Survey Sample Information” for more information). The AHRQ website provides more details about the identification and analytic considerations regarding sample persons who are inscope only part of the year
. 
2.5.1  Survey Administration Variables (DUID - RURSLT53 ) 
The survey administration variables contain information related to conducting the interview, household and family composition, and person-level and RU- level status codes. Data for the 
survey administration variables were derived from the sampling process, the CAPI programs, or were computed based on information provided by the respondent in the R eenumeration section 
of the questionnaire. Most survey administration variables on this file are asked during every round of the MEPS interview. They describe data for Rounds 5/3/1, 6/4/2, 7/5/3 status and status as of December 31, 2020.  
This ye ar, the data collected includes a third panel, Panel 23, which was extended past the usual 
five rounds of data collection to include sixth and seventh round interviews. In order to 
incorporate the third year Panel 23 Round 5, Round 6, and Round 7 data into the delivery without adding new variables, a decision was made to use the ‘31’/’42’/’53’ variables to also hold the third year panel data. Retaining the standard ’31’/’42’/’53’ variable names, even with the addition of the third year panel, will allow eas ier comparison to previous FY data.  
For example, where variables ending in ‘53’ would normally hold data for Panel 24 Round 5 and Panel 25 Round 3, they also now hold data for Panel 23 Round 7. Similarly, Panel 23 Round 6 data have been added to the ‘42’ variables as well as the ‘31’ variables. Panel 23 Round 5 data have been added to the ‘31’ variables. This means that the ‘31’ variables contain data for Rounds 1, 3, and 5, the ‘42’ variables contain data for Rounds 2, 4, and 6, and the ‘53’ variables contain data for Rounds 3, 5, and 7. For the ‘31’ variables, Round 5 values are most often copied from the Round 6 interview in 2020 because the Panel 25 Round 5 interview collected data as of December 31, 2019. However, for some variables (such as employment and health insurance), Round 5 and 6 data were used to create values that reflect the 2020 portion of Round 5, specifically, the employment or health insurance status between January 1, 2020 and the Round 5 interview date in 2020. 
Please note that the Pan el 23 Round 5 reference period ended on December 31, 2019, which 
means that there are no 2020 data to populate the ‘31’ administrative and demogr aphic variables

for Panel 23. In order that the ‘31’ variables for Panel 23 not be empty, the Round 6 data were 
copied from the ‘42’ variables into the ‘31’ variables as a substitute for Round 5, 2020 data for analysis purposes. 
The December 31, 2020 variables were developed in two ways. Those used in the construction of 
eligibility, inscope, and the end reference date were based on an exact date. The remaining variables were constructed using data from specific rounds, if available. If data were missing from the target round but were available in another round, data from that other round were used in the variable construction. If no valid data were available during any round of data collection, an appropriate reserved code was assigned.  
Dwelling Units, Reporting Units, and Families  
The definitions of Dwelling Units (DUs) in the MEPS Household Survey are generally consistent with the definitions employed for the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). The 
Dwelling Unit ID (DUID) is a seven -digit ID number consisting of a 2-digit panel number 
followed by a five-digit random number assigned after the case was sampled f or MEPS. A 
three-digit person number (PID) uniquely identifies each person within the DU. The variable DUPERSID is the combination of the variables DUID and PID. As part of the new CAPI design, the lengths of the ID variables have changed in the file. An  additional 2 bytes in the IDs resulted 
from adding a 2-digit panel number to the beginning of all the IDs.  
PANEL is a constructed variable used to specify the panel number for the person. PAN EL will 
indicate Panel  23, Panel 2 4, or Panel 2 5 for e ach person on the file. Panel 23 is the panel that 
started in 2018, Panel 24  is the panel that started in 2019, and Panel 25 i s the panel that started in 
2020. The panel number is included as the first two digits of the DUID and DUPERSID.  A Reporting Unit (RU) is a person or group of persons in the sampled DU who are related by 
blood, marriage, adoption, or other family association. Each RU was interviewed as a single entity for MEPS. Thus, the RU serves chiefly as a family-based “survey” operations unit r ather 
than an analytic unit. Members of each RU within the DU are identified in the pertinent three rounds by the round-specific variables RULETR31, RULETR42, and RULETR53. End-of- year 
status (as of December 31, 2020 or the last round they were in the survey) is indicated by the RULETR20  variable. Regardless of the legal status of their association, two persons living 
together as a “family” unit were treated as a single RU if they chose to be so identified.  
Examples of different types of RUs are:  
1. A married  daughter and her husband living with her parents in the same DU 
constitute a single RU;  
2. A husband and wife and their unmarried daughter, age 18, who is living away from 
home while at college constitute two RUs; and  
3. Three unrelated persons living in the sa me DU would each constitute a distinct RU 
(a total of three RUs).

Unmarried coll
ege students (less than 24 years of age) who usually live in the sampled 
household but were living away from home and going to school at the time of the Round 3/1 
MEPS intervie w were treated as an RU separate from that of their parents for the purpose of data 
collection.  
The round-specific variables RUSIZE31, RUSIZE42, RUSIZE53, and the end-of- year status 
variable RUSIZE20  indicate the number of persons in each RU, treating stu dents as single RUs 
separate from their parents. Thus, students are not included in the RUSIZE count of their 
parents’ RU. However, for many analytic objectives, the student RUs would be combined with their parents’ RU, treating the combined entity as a si ngle family. Family identifier and size 
variables are described below and include students with their parents’ RU. 
The round-specific variables FAMID31, FAMID42, FAMID53, and the end-of- year status 
variable FAMID20  identify a family (i.e., persons related to one another by blood, marriage, 
adoption, or self-identified as a single unit) for each round and as of December 31, 2020. The 
FAMID variables differ from the RULETR variables only in that student RUs are combined with their parents’ RU.  
Two other family identifiers, FAMIDYR and CPSFAMID, are provided on this file. The annualized family ID letter, FAMIDYR, identifies eligible members of the eligible annualized families within a DU. The CPSFAMID represents a redefinition of MEPS families into families defined by the Current Population Survey (CPS). Some of the distinctions between CPS-and 
MEPS -defined families are that MEPS families include and CPS families do not include: non -
married partners, and in- laws. These persons are considered as members of separate families for 
CPS-like families. CPS -like families are defined so a poverty status classification variable 
consistent with established definitions of poverty can be assigned to the CPS- like families and 
used for weight poststratification purposes. In order to identify a person’s family affiliation, users must create a unique set of FAMID variables by concatenating the DU identifier and the FAMID variable. Instructions for creating family estimates are described in Section 3.6. 
The round- specific variables  FAMSZE31, FAMSZE42, FAMSZE53, and the end-of- year status 
variable FAMSZE20  indicate the number of persons associated with a single family unit after 
students are linked to their associated parent RUs for analytical purposes. Family- level analyses 
should use the FAMSZE variables.  
Note that the variables RUSIZ E31, RUSIZE42, RUSIZE53, RUSIZE20, FAMSZE31, 
FAMSZ E42, FAMSZE53, and FAMSZE20 exclude persons who are ineligible for data 
collection (i.e., those where ELGRND31 NE 1, ELGRND42 NE 1, ELGRND53 NE 1 or 
ELG RND20  NE 1); analysts should exclude ineligible persons in a given round from all 
family -level analyses for that round. 
The round-specific variables RURSLT31, RURSLT42, and RURSLT53 indicate the RU response status for each round. Users should note that the values for RURSLT31 differ from those for RURSLT42 and RURSLT53. The values for RURSLT31 include the following:

Standard or primary RUs are the original RUs from NHIS. A new RU is one created when 
members of the household leave the primary RU and are followed according to the rules of the survey. A student RU is an unmarried college student (under 24 years of age) who is considered a usual member of the household, but was living away from home while going to school, and was treated as a Reporting Unit (RU) separate from his or her parents’ RU for the purpose of data collection. RUCLAS20 was set based on the RUCLAS values from Rounds 5/3/1, 6/4/2, and 7/5/3. If the person was present in the responding RU in Round 7/5/3, then RUCLAS20 was set to RUCLAS53. If the person was not present in a responding RU in Round 7/5/3 but was present in Round 6/4/2, then RUCLAS20 was set to RUCLAS42. If the person was not present in 
either Rounds 6/4/2 or 7/5/3 but was present in Round 5/3/1 (note that for this variable, the Panel 23 Round 6 value was copied into Panel 23 Round 5), then RUCLAS 20 was set to RUCLAS31. 
If the person was not linked to a responding RU during any round, then RUCLAS20 was set to -15. 
Geographic Variables 
The round-specific variables REGION31, REGION42, REGION53, and the end-of- year status 
variable REGION 20 indicate the Census region for the RU. REGION20 indicates the region for 
the 2020 portion of Round 7/5/3. For most analyses, REGION20 should be used.  
The values and states for each region include the following:

Reference Period Dates 
The reference period is the period of time for which data were collected in each round for each person. The reference period dates were determined during the interview for each person by the CAPI program. The round- specific beginning reference period dates are included for each 
person. These variables include BEGRFM31, BEGRFY31, BEGRFM42, BEGRFY42, BEGRFM53, and BEGRFY53. The reference period for Round 1 for most persons began on January 1, 2020 and ended on the date of the Round 1 interview. For RU members who joined later in Round 1, the beginning Round 1 reference date was the date the person entered the RU. For all subsequent rounds, the reference period for most persons began on the date of the previous round’s interview and ended on the date of the current round’s interview. Persons who joined after the previous round’s interview had their beginning reference date for the round set to the day they joined the RU. 
The round-specific ending reference period dates for Rounds 5/3/1 (note that for this variable, 
the Panel 23 Round 6 value was copied into Panel 23 Round 5), 6/4/2, and 7/ 5/3 as well as the 
end-of-year reference period end date variables are also included for each person. These 
variables include ENDRFM31, ENDRFY31, ENDRFM42, ENDRFY 42, ENDRFM53, 
ENDRFY53, ENDRFM 20, and ENDRFY20. For most persons in the sample, the date of the 
round’s interview is the reference period end date. Note that the end date of the r eference period 
for a person is prior to the date of the interview if the person was deceased during the round, left the RU, was institutionalized prior to that round’s interview, or left the RU to join the military. For a small number of cases, the reference period dates may be recoded for confidentiality.  
Reference Person Identifiers 
The round-specific variables REFPRS31, REFPRS42, and REFPRS53 and the end-of- year status 
variable REFPRS 20 identify the reference person for Rounds 5/3/1 (note that for this variable, 
the Panel 23 Round 6 value was copied into Panel 23 Round 5), 6/4/2 and 7/5/3, and as of December 31, 20 20 (or the last round they were in the survey). In general, the reference person is 
defined as the household member 16 years of age or older who owns or rents the home. If more than one person meets this description, the household respondent identifies one from among

================================================================================

them. If the res
pondent is unable to identify a person fitting this definition, the questionnaire asks 
for the head of household and this person is then considered the reference person for that RU. 
This information is collected in the Reenumeration section of the CAPI questionnaire. 
Respondent Identifiers  
The respondent is the person who answered the interview questions for the Repor ting Unit (RU). 
The round-specific variables RESP31, RESP42, and RESP53 and the end-of- year status variable 
RESP 20 identify the respondent for Rounds 5/3/1 (note that for this variable, the Panel 23 Round 
6 value was copied into Panel 23 Round 5), 6/4/2, and  7/5/3 and as of December 31, 2020 (or the 
last round they were in the survey). Only one respondent is identified for each RU. In instances where the interview was completed in more than one session, only the first respondent is indicated.  
There are tw o types of respondents. The respondent can be either an RU member or a non- RU 
member proxy. The round-specific variables PROXY31, PROXY42, and PROXY53 and the 
end-of-year status variable PROXY 20 identify the type of respondent for Rounds 5/3/1 (note that 
for this variable, the Panel 23 Round 6 value was copied into Panel 23 Round 5), 6/4/2, 7/5/3 and as of December 31, 2020 (or the last round they were in the survey).  
Language of Interview  
The language of interview variable (INTVLANG) is a summary value of  the round- specific RU -
level information section question (RU30), which asks the interviewer to record the language in which the interview was completed: English, Spanish, Both English and Spanish, Other Language. Given the first round that the person was part of the study and the person’s associated RU for that round, INTVLANG is assigned the interview language value reported for the person’s RU for the round. 
Person Status  
A number of variables describe the various components reflecting each person’s status for each round of data collection. These variables provide information about a person’s in-scope status, Keyness status, eligibility status, and disposition status. These variables include: KEYNESS, INSCOP 31, INSCOP42, INSCOP53, INSCOP 20, INSC1231, INSC OPE, ELGRND31, 
ELGRND42, ELGRND53, ELGRND20, PSTATS31, PSTATS42, and PSTATS53. These variables are set based on sampling information  and responses provided in the R eenumeration 
section of the CAPI questionnaire. 
Through the Reenumeration section of the CAP I questionnaire, each member of an RU was 
classified as “Key” or “Non -Key”, “in -scope” or “out-of- scope”, and “eligible” or “ineligible” 
for MEPS data collection. To be included in the set of persons used in the derivation of MEPS 
person- level estimates, a  person had to be a member of the civilian noninstitutionalized 
population for at least one day during 2020. Because a person’s eligibility for the survey might have changed since the NHIS interview, a sampling reenumeration of household membership

was con ducted at the s
tart of each round’s interview. Only persons who were “inscope” 
sometime during the year, were “Key”, and responded for the full period in which they were 
inscope were assigned positive person-level weights and thus are to be used in the derivation of person- level national estimates from the MEPS.  
Note: If analysts want to su bset to infants born during 2020, then newborns should be identified 
using AGE 20X = 0 rather than PSTATSxy = 51.  
Inscope  
The round- specific variables INSCOP31, INSCOP42, and INSCOP53 indicate a person’s 
in-scope status for Rounds 5/3/1 (note that for this variable, the Panel 23 Round 6 value was 
copied into Panel 23 Round 5), 6/4/2, and 7/ 5/3. INSCOP 20, INSC1231, and INSCOPE indicate 
a person’s in-scope status for the portion of Round 7/5/3 that covers 2020, the person’s in- scope 
status as of 12/31/20, and whether a person was ever in -scope during the calendar year 2020. A 
person was considered as in- scope during a round or a referenced time period if he or she was a 
member of the U.S. civilian, noninstitutionalized population at some time during that round or that time period. The values of these variables taken in conjunction allow one to determine in-scope status over time (for example, becoming inscope in the middle of a round, as would be 
the case for newborns). These variables may contain the following values and corresponding labels:  
Value  Definition  
0 Incorrectly listed, or on NHIS roster but out-of-scope prior to January 1, 2020 
1 Person is inscope for the whole reference period  
2 Person is inscope at the start of the RU reference period, but not at the end of the RU reference period  
3 Person is not inscope at the start of RU reference period, but is inscope at the end of the RU reference period. (For example, the person is inscope from the date the person joined the RU or the person was in the military in the previous round, but is no longer in the military in the current round) 
4 Person is inscope during the reference period, but neither at the reference start date nor on the reference end date. (For example, person leaves an institution, goes into community, and then dies)  
5 Person is out-of-scope for all of the reference period during which he or she is an RU member. (For example, the person is in the military)  
6 Person is out-of- scope for the entire reference period and is not a member of 
the RU during this time period and was inscope and an RU member in an earlier round  
7 Person is not in an RU, joined in a later round (or joine d the RU after

Value  Definition  
8 RU Non -response and Key persons who left an RU with no tracing info and 
so a new RU was not formed  
9 Person is not a member of an RU during this time period, and was an RU 
member in an earlier round  
Keyness 
The term “Keyness” is related to an individual’s chance of being included in MEPS. A person is Key if that person is linked for sampling purposes to the set of NHIS sampled households designated for inclusi on in MEPS. Specifically, a Key person was either a member of a 
responding NHIS household at the time of interview, or joined a family associated with such a household after being out-of- scope at the time of the NHIS (examples of the latter situation 
inclu de newborns and those returning from military service, an institution, or residence in a 
foreign country). 
A non- Key person is one whose chance of selection for the NHIS (and MEPS) was associated 
with a household eligible but not sampled for the NHIS and who later became a member of a 
MEPS Reporting Unit. MEPS data (e.g., utilization and expenditures) were collected for the period of time a non-Key person was part of the sampled unit to provide information for family -level analyses. However, non- Key person s who leave a sample household unaccompanied 
by a Key, in -scope member were not followed for subsequent interviews. Non-Key individuals 
do not receive sample person-level weights and thus do not contribute to person- level national 
estimates.  
The variable K EYNESS indicates a person’s Keyness status. This variable is not round- specific. 
Instead, it is set at the time the person enters MEPS, and the person’s Keyness status never changes. Once a person is determined to be Key, that person will always be Key. 
It should be pointed out that a person might be Key even though not part of the civilian, 
noninstitutionalized portion of the U.S. population. For example, a person in the military may 
have been living with his or her civilian spouse and children in a household sampled for NHIS. The person in the military would be considered a Key person for MEPS; however, such a person would not be eligible to receive a person- level sample weight if he or s he was never inscope 
during 2020. 
Eligibility  
The eligibility of a pe rson for MEPS pertains to whether or not data were to be collected for that 
person. All of the Key in-scope persons of a sampled RU were eligible for data collection. The only non-Key persons eligible for data collection were those who happened to be living in an RU with at least one Key, in -scope person. Their eligibility continued only for the time that they 
were living with at least one such person. The only out-of- scope persons eligible for data 
collection were those who were living with Key in -scope persons, again only for the time they

================================================================================

were living with s
uch a person. Only military persons can meet this description (for example, a 
person on full- time active duty military, living with a spouse who is Key).  
A person may be classified as eligible for an entire round or for some part of a round. For 
persons who are eligible for only part of a round (for example, persons may have been institutionalized during a round), data were collected for the period of time for which that person was classified as eligibl e. The round-specific variables ELGRND31, ELGRND42, and 
ELGRND53 indicate a person’s eligibility status for Rounds 5/3/1, 6/4/2, and 7/5/3 respectively, with the end-of- year status variable ELGRND20 indicating a person’s eligibility status  as of 
December 3 1, 2020. Note that for ELGRND31, the Panel 23 Round 6 value was copied into 
Panel 23 Round 5. 
For Panel 23, since there were no 2020 data for Round 5, and Round 6 data were copied from the 
‘42’ variables to the ‘31’ variables, there will be a few instances for Eligibility (as well as Person Disposition Status) where it looks like a person leaves twice (death/enters an institution) or enters the RU twice.  
Person Disposition Status  
The round-specific variables PSTATS31, PSTATS42, and PSTATS53 indicate a person’s response and eligibility status for each round of interviewing. The PSTATSxy variables indicate the reasons for either continuing or terminating data collection for each person in the MEPS. Using this variable, one could identify persons who moved during the reference period, died, were born, institutionalized, or who were in the military. Analysts should note that PSTATS53 provides a summary for all of Round 7/5/3, including tran sitions that occurred after 2020. Note 
that some categories may be collapsed for confidentiality purposes. 
The following codes specify the value labels for the PSTATSxy variables.

Panel 23 Round 5 data were collected in 2019 only. Round 6 data were collected in 2020 and 
were thus substituted for Round 5 data in all the following ‘31’ survey administration variables.

2.5.2  Navigating the MEPS Data with Information on Person Disposition Status    
Since the variables PSTATS31, PSTATS42, and PSTATS53 indicate the reasons for either continuing or terminating data collection for each person in MEPS, these variables can be used to explain the beginning and ending dates for each individual’s reference period of data collection, as well as which sections in the instrument each individual did not receive. By using the information included in the following table, analysts will be able to determine for each individual which sections of the MEPS questionnaire collected data elements for that person. 
Some individuals have a reference period that spans an entire round, while other individuals may 
have data collected only for a portion of the round. When an individual’s reference period does not coincide with the RU reference period, the individual’s start date may be a later date, or the end date may be an earlier date, or both. In addition, some individuals have reference period information coded as “Inapplicable” (e.g., for individuals who were not actually in the household). The information in this table indicates the beginning and ending dates of reference periods for persons with various values of PSTATS31, PSTATS42, and PSTATS53. The actual dates for each individual can be found in the following variables included on this file: BEGRFM31, BEGRFM42, BEGRFM53, BEGRFY31, BEGRFY42, BEGRFY53, ENDRFM31, ENDRFM42, ENDRFM53, ENDRFY31, ENDRFY42, ENDRFY53, ENDRFM20, and ENDRFY20. 
The table below also describes the section or sections of the questionnaire that were NOT  asked 
for each value of PSTATS31, PSTATS42, and PSTATS53. For example, the Closing (CL) 
section contains some questions or question rosters that exclude certain persons depending on whether the person died, became institutionalized, or otherwise left the RU; however, no one is considered to have skipped the entire section. Some questions or sections (e.g., Health Status (HE), Employment (RJ, EM, EW)) are skipped if individuals are not within a certain age range. Since the PSTATS variables do not address skip patterns based on age, analysts will need to use the appropriate age variables.

The paper- and-pencil
 Self-Administered Questionnaire (SAQ) was designed to collect 
information during Panel 2 5 Round 2, Panel 2 4 Round 4, and Panel 23 Round 6. A person was 
considered eligible to receive an SAQ if that person did not have a status of deceased or 
institutionalized, did not move out of the U.S. or to a military facility, was not a non- response at 
the time of the Round 2, Round 4, or Round 6 interview date, and was 18 years of age or older. No RU members added in Round 3 or Round 5 were asked to complete an SAQ questionnaire. Because PSTATS variables do not address skip patterns based on age, this questionnaire was not included in the table below. Once again, analysts will need to use the appropriate age variable, which in this case would be AGE42X. The documentation for this questionnaire appears in the SAQ section of this docume nt under “Health Status Variables.”  
Please note that the end reference date shown below for PSTATS53 reflects the Round 7/5/3 reference period rather than the portion of Round 7/5/3 that occurred during 2020.

2.5.3  Demographic Variables (AGE31X- DAPID53X)  
General Information  
Demographic variables provide information about the demographic characteristics of each 
person from the MEPS HC. The characteristics include age, sex, race, ethnicity, marital status, educational attainment, and military service. As noted below, some variables have edited and imputed values. Most demographic variables on this file were asked during every round of the MEP S interview. These variables describe data for Rounds 5, 6, and 7 for Panel 23 (the panel 
that started in 2018), Rounds 3, 4, and 5 of Panel 24 (the p anel that started in 2019); Rounds 1, 2 
and 3 of Panel 25 (the panel that started in 20 20); a nd status as of December 31, 2020.  
Demographic variables that have variable names that contain ‘31’, ‘42’, or ‘53’ are round- specific variables. As mentioned in Section 2.4 “Variable Naming”, third year panel data 
for Rounds 5, 6, and 7 of Panel 23 are included in the ‘31’/’42’/’53’ sets of variables. For example, AGE31X represents the age data relevant to Round 3 of Panel 24 or Round 1 of Panel  25, but for FY20, AGE31X also includes data for Round 6 of Panel 23. (This would 
normally contain Round 5 age, but for FY20 Round 6 values are copied into Round 5.) T he 
variable PANEL indicates the panel from which the data were derived. A value of 23 indicates Panel 23 data, a value of 2 4 indicates Panel 24  data, and a value of 2 5 indicates Panel 2 5 data. 
The remaining demographic variables on this file are not round- specific.  
 C-22 MEPS HC -224 
 


================================================================================
PÁGINA 31
================================================================================

The variables describing demographic status of the person as of December 31, 2020 were 
developed in two ways . First, the age variable (AGE20X) represents the exact age, calculated 
from date of birth and indicates age status as of 12/31/ 20. For the remaining December 31st 
variables [i.e., re lated to marital status (MARRY 20X, SPOUID20, SPOUIN 20), student status 
(FTSTU20 X), and the relationship to reference persons (REFRL20X)], the following algorithm 
was used: data were taken from the Round 7/5/3 counterpart if non- missing; else, if missing, data 
were taken from the Round 6/4/2 counterpart; else from the Round 5/3/1 counterpart (note that for this variable, the Panel 23 Round 6 value was copied into Panel 23 Round 5). If no valid data were available during any of these rounds of data collection, the algorithm assigned the missing value (other than -1 “Inapplicable”) from the first round that the person was part of the study. When al l three rounds were set to -1, a value of -15 “Cannot be Computed” was assigned. 
Age 
Date of birth and age for each RU member were asked or verified during each MEPS interview (DOBMM, DOBYY, AGE31X, AGE42X, AGE53X). If date of birth was available, age was calculated based on the difference between date of birth and date of interview. Inconsistencies between the calculated age and the age reported during the CAPI interview were reviewed and resolved. For purposes of confidentiality, the variables AGE31X, AGE 42X, AGE53X, AGE 20X, 
and AGELAST were top -coded at 85 years.  
When date of birth was not provided but age was provided (either from the MEPS interviews or the 2017-2019 NHIS data), the month and year of birth were assigned randomly from among the possible valid options. For any cases still not accounted for, age was imputed using:  
1. the mean age difference between MEPS participants with certain family relationships(where available) or
2. the mean age value for MEPS participants.
For example, a mother’s age i s imputed as her child’s age plus 26, where 26 is the mean age 
difference between MEPS mothers and their children. A wife’s age is imputed as the husband’s 
age minus 3, where 3 is the mean age difference between MEPS wives and husbands. Age was 
imputed in t his w ay for  9 persons on this file.  
AGELAST i ndicates a person’s a ge from  the last time the person  was eligible for  data collection  
during  a specifi c calendar year. T he age range for  this va riable is be tween 0 an d 85. 
Sex 
Data on the sex of each RU member (SEX) were initially determined from the 2017 NHIS for 
Panel 23, from the 2018 NHIS for Panel 24, and from the 2019 NHIS for Panel 25. The SEX 
variable was verified and, if necessary, corrected during each MEPS interview. The d ata for new 
RU members (persons who were not members of the RU at the time of the NHIS interviews) 
were also obtained during each MEPS round. When sex of the RU member was not available 
from the NHIS interviews and was not determined during one of the subsequent MEPS

================================================================================

interviews, it was assigned in the following way. The person’s first name was used to assign sex 
if obvious (no cases were resolved in this way). If the person’s first name provided no indication 
of sex, then family relationships were reviewed (no cases were resolved this way ). If neither of 
these approaches made it possible to determine the individual’s sex, sex was randomly assigned 
(no c ases were resolved this way).  
Race a nd Ethnicity G roup 
The race and  the ethnic background questions were asked for each RU member during the MEPS 
interview . If the information was not obtained in Round 1, the questions were asked in 
subsequent rounds . It should be noted that race/ethnicity questions in the MEPS were revised 
starting  with data collection  in 2013 f or Panel 16 Round 5, Panel 17 Round 3, and Panel 18 
Round 1; this affected data starting with the FY 2012 file. Previously, there were two race 
questions, but starting with data collection in 2013, there is only one race question. All Asian 
categories l isted in the second question were moved to the new single question. In addition, the 
new r ace question  had additional de tail for the Native Hawaiian and  Other Pacifi c Islander 
categories. The main change for ethnicity is that the new questions allowed respondents to report 
more than one  Hispanic ethnicity. R ace/ethnicity d ata from  earlier years m ay not  be directly 
comparable. The following table shows the variables used for FY 2002- 2011 and FY 2012 -2020, 
with these exceptions: 1) in FY 2012, RACEV1X categories 4 and 5 were not combined but are 
combined starting with 2013, and 2) RACEV2X and HISPNCAT were first introduced in 2013.

Race and ethnicity variables and their response categories for years prior to 2002 are available in the documentation for the FY Consolidated PUF for each data year. 
Values for these variables were obtained based on the following priority order. If available, data 
collected were used to determine race and ethnicity. If  race and/or ethnicity were not reported in 
the interview, then data obtained from the originally coll ected NHIS data were used. ( 2 cases 
were resolved this way for race, and 1 case was  resolved this way for ethnicity.) If still not 
determined, the race, and/or ethnicity were assigned based on relationship to other members of 
the DU using a priority orderi ng that gave precedence to blood relatives in the immediate family 
(this approach was used on 16 persons to set race and 7 persons to set ethnicity).  
For the FY12 and FY13 PUFs, three new race variables were constructed for both the old and the 
new questi ons: RACEVER, RACEV1X, and RACETHX. The variable RACEVER was 
constructed to indicate which version of the race question(s) was asked and was included in only the 2012 and 2013 FY PUFs. RACEVER has been dropped starting with the 2014 PUF. The variables RACE V1X and RACETHX replace the variables RACEX and RACETHNX from 
2002-2011. A new race variable, RACEV2X, was constructed only for the new race question and was added for the first time to the 2013 files. RACEV2X was set to -1 “Inapplicable” for persons that were not asked the new race question in FY13 only. This variable includes the expanded detail Asian categories and continues to be constructed for all PUFs. 
The “multiple races reported” categories for RACEV1X and RACEV2X differ in the 2013-2015 
PUFs but are the same starting with the 2016 PUF. In the 2013-2015 PUFs, persons with multiple Asian races or multiple Hawaiian/Pacific Islander races were considered multiple races for RACEV2X and were not considered multiple races for RACEV1X. Starting with the 2016

PUFs, perso
ns with multiple Asian races or multiple Hawaiian/Pacific Islander races were no 
longer considered multiple races in RACEV2X.  
For the FY12 and FY13 PUFs, the two Hispanic ethnicity variables from previous years were 
included: HISPANX and HISPCAT. The HISPANX variable continues to be constructed. The HISPCAT variable was constructed for specific Hispanic categories based only on the old question in FY12 and FY13 and HISPCAT has been dropped starting with the 2014 PUF. A new ethnicity variable,  HISPNCAT, based on the new question, was introduced starting with 2013. 
HISPNCAT includes similar categories as HISPCAT but in a different order, and contains an additional category, 8 “Multiple Hispanic Groups Reported”, to represent any multiple respons es 
reported. HISPNCAT was set to -1 “Inapplicable” for persons that were not asked the new ethnicity question in FY13. This variable continues to be constructed for all PUFs. 
Categories have been collapsed in the variables RACEV1X, RACEV2X and HISPNCAT. For 
RACEV1X, new with the 2012 PUF, categories 4 and 5 were collapsed in category 4 as “ASIAN/NATV HAWAIIAN/PACFC ISL -NO OTH” starting with the 2013 PUF. For 
RACEV2X, new with and starting with the 2013 PUF, categories 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 were collapsed in c ategory 10 as “OTH ASIAN/NATV HAWAIIAN/PACFC ISL -NO OTH,” and for 
HISPNCAT, new with and starting with the 2013 PUF, categories 6 and 7 were collapsed in category 6 as “OTH LAT AM/HISP/LATINO/SPNSH ORGN- NO OTH”.  
Language Variables: OTHLGSPK, WHTLGSPK, and HWELLSPK  
Language variables (OTHLGSPK, WHTLGSPK, and HWELLSPK) were collected at the person 
level in the round in which the person entered the MEPS survey. Beginning with Panel 23 
Round 1, the household respondent was asked for each person, age 5 or older, a person- level 
question to determine whether that person speaks a language other than English at home (RE1170, OTHLGSPK). If the response to OTHLGSPK was ‘yes’, then two other questions were asked. WHTLGSPK (RE1170) is a person-level question that asks whether the non- English 
language spoken at home is Spanish or some other language, and HWELLSPK (RE1170) is a person-level question that asks how well that person can speak English. If the response to OTHLGSPK was ‘No’, then WHTLGSPK and HWELLSPK are set to ‘ -1’ (Inapplicable). 
Family members who are deceased or institutionalized in Round 1 are coded with a value of ‘- 1’ 
(Inapplicable). Minors under age 5 in households have all three variables coded to “5” (Under 5 years old - Inapplicable).  
For users doing multiyear analyses, please carefully review prior years’ documentation to assure correct interpretation of language variables over time.  
Foreign Born Status  
Three questions regarding fore ign-born status were asked in the Demographic section to 
ascertain whether a person was born in the U.S. (RE1170), what year they came to the U.S. (RE1170) if not born in the U.S., and years lived in the U.S. (RE1170) if the response to RE1170 was ‘Don’t K now’. They replaced similar questions that had been asked in the Access to Care 
section prior to 2013.  
 C-28 MEPS HC -224 
 


================================================================================

================================================================================

The three questions
 were only asked once for each eligible person, that is, the first round the 
person was included in the interview. These new questions were asked of everyone, except 
deceased and institutionalized persons. The data from RE1170 are reported as the constructed variable BORNUSA. The data from RE1170 (YRCAMEUS) and RE1170 ( YRSINUSA) were 
used to calculate the number of years a person has li ved in the U.S. for the constructed variable 
YRSINUS. Please note that YRSINUS is a discrete variable and has collapsed categories: 1 “less than 1 year”; 2 “1 yr., less than 5 years”; 3 “5 yrs., less than 10 years”; 4 “10 yrs., less than 15 years”; 5 “15 y ears or more”.  
Marital Status and Spouse ID  
Current marital status was collected and/or updated during every round of the MEPS interview. This information was obtained in RE100 and RE1170 and is reported as MARRY31X, MARRY42X, MARRY53X, and MARRY20X. Perso ns under the age of 16 were coded as 6 
“Under 16 - Inapplicable”. If marital status of a specified round differed from that of the previous round, then the marital status of the specified round was edited to reflect a change during the round (e.g., married in round, divorced in round, separated in round, or widowed in round). 
In instances where there were discrepancies between the marital statuses of two individuals 
within a family, other person- level variables were reviewed to determine the edited marital status 
for each individual. Thus, when one spouse was reported as married and the other spouse reported as widowed, the data were reviewed to determine if one partner should be coded as  8 “Widowed in Round”. 
Edits were performed to ensure some consistency across rounds. First, a person could not be 
coded as “Never Married” after previously being coded as any other marital status (e.g., “Widowed”). Second, a person could not be coded as “Under 16 - Inapplicable” after being 
previously coded as any other mar ital status. Third, a person could not be coded as “Married in 
Round” after being coded as “Married” in the round immediately preceding. Fourth, a person could not be coded as an “in Round” code (e.g., “Widowed in Round”) in two subsequent rounds. Since ma rital status can change across rounds and it was not feasible to edit every 
combination of values across rounds, unlikely sequences for marital status across the round- specific variables do exist.  
The person identifier for each individual’s spouse is reported in SPOUID31, SPOUID42, SPOUID53, and SPOUID20. These are the PIDs (within each family) of the person identified as the spouse during Round 5/3/1 (note that for this variable, the Panel 23 Round 6 value was copied into Panel 23 Round 5), Round 6/4/2, and Round 7/5/3 and as of December 31, 2020, respectively. If no spouse was identified in the household, the variable was coded as 995 “No Spouse in House”. Those with unknown marital status are coded as 996 “Marital Status Unknown”. Persons under the age of 16 are coded as 997 “Less than 16 Years Old”. 
The SPOUIN31, SPOUIN42, SPOUIN53, and SPOUIN20 variables indicate whether a person’s 
spouse was present in the RU during Round 5/3/1 (note that for this variable, the Panel 23 Round 6 value was copied into Panel 23 Round 5), Round 6/4/2, Round 7/5/3 and as of December 31,

2020 respectively. If the person had no spouse in the household, the value was coded as 2 “Not 
Married/No Spouse”. For persons under the age of 16 the value was coded as 3 “Under 16 - Inapp licable”.  
The SPOUID and SPOUIN variables were obtained from RE900, where the respondent was asked to identify how each pair of persons in the household was related. Analysts should note that this information was collected in a set of questions separate fr om the questions that asked 
about marital status. While editing was performed to ensure that SPOUID and SPOUIN are consistent within each round, there was no consistency check between these variables and marital status in a given round. Apparent discrepancies between marital status and spouse information may be due to any of the following causes: 
1. Ambiguity as to when during a round a change in marital status occurred. This is aresult of relationship information being asked for all persons living in the householdat any time during the round, while marital status is asked as of the interview date(e.g., If one spouse died during the reference period, the surviving spouse’s maritalstatus would be “Widowed in Round”, but SPOUIN and SPOUID for the same roundwould indicate that a spouse was present).
2. Valid discrepancies in the case of persons who are married but not living with theirspouse, or separating but still living together.
3. Discrepancies that cannot be explained for either of the previous reasons.
Stud ent Status and Educational Attainment 
The variables FTSTU31X, FTSTU42X, FTSTU53X, and FTSTU20X indicate whether the person was a full- time student at the interview  date (or 12/31/20 for FTSTU20X). These 
variables have valid values for all persons between the ages of 17 - 23 inclusive. When this question was asked during Round 1 of Panel 25, it was based on age as of the 2019 NHIS interview date.  
Education questions were only asked when persons first entered MEPS, typically Round 1 for most people. It should be noted that education questions were changed with data collection in 2012 and then changed back to the original questions with data collection in 2015. The variables associated with the orig inal education questions (data collection in 2011 and prior years and 
2015 and subsequent years) are EDUCYR and HIDEG. The variable associated with the interim education question (data collection in 2012- 2014) is EDUYRDEG (or EDUYRDG with 
collapsed categories). The variable EDRECODE relates variables for the original and interim education questions. As a result, different education variables are in the 2011-2015 PUFs based on the panel and round when a person first entered MEPS. The PUF documentation for each of the 2011-2015 years contains details about which education variables are in the respective files. Starting with the 2016 PUFs, EDUCYR and HIDEG are the only education variables on the PUFs.  
EDUCYR contains the number of years of education completed when entering MEPS for 
individuals 5 years or older. Children under the age of 5 years were coded as -1 “Inapplicable”

regardless of w
hether they attended school. Individuals who were 5 years of age or older and had 
never attended school were coded as 0. The user should note that EDUCYR is an unedited 
variable and minimal data cleaning was performed on this variable.  
HIDEG contains information on the highest degree of education attained at the time the 
individual entered MEPS. Information was obtained from three questions: highest grade completed, high school diploma, and highest degree. Persons under 16 years of age when they first entered MEPS were coded as 8 “Under 16 - Inapplicable”. In cases where the response to 
the highest degree question was “No Degree” and the response to the highest grade question was 13 through 17, the variable HIDEG was coded as 3 “High School Diploma”. If the response to the highest grade completed was “Refused” or “Don’t Know” and the response to the highest degree question was  “No Degree”, the variable HIDEG was coded as 1 “No Degree”. The user 
should note that HIDEG is an unedited variable and minimal data cleaning was performed on this variable.  
Military Service  
Information on active duty military status was collected during  each round of the MEPS 
interview. Persons currently on full- time active duty status are identified in the variables 
ACTDTY31, ACTDTY42, and ACTDTY53. Those under 16 years of age were coded as 3 “Under 16 - Inapplicable”, and those over the age of 59 were coded as 4 “Over 59 - Inapplicable”.  
Relationship to the Reference Person within Reporting Units  
For each Reporting Unit (RU), the person who owns or rents the DU is usually defined as the reference person. For student RUs, the student is defined as the reference person. (For additional information on reference persons, see the documentation on survey administration variables.) The relationship variables indicate the relationship of each individual to the reference person of the Reporting Unit (RU) in a giv en round.  
For confidentiality, starting in 2013, detailed relationships were combined into more general categories in the variables REFRL31X,  REFRL42X, REFRL53X, and REFRL20X. These 
variables replaced RFREL31X, RFREL42X, RFREL53X, and RFRELyyX used before 2013. 
The new and old variables are defined differently, so researchers using multiple years of MEPS 
should refer to prior years’ documentation to assure consistency in their data. 
Note that categories for Child (4), Parent (7), and Sibling (8) for REFRL3 1X, REFRL42X, 
REFRL53X, and REFRL20X changed in 2017. In 2013-2016, these categories included 
biological, adoptive, step relationships, as well as in- law and foster relationships. Starting in 
2017, in-law relationships are included in 91 OTHER RELATED, SPECIFY. Foster children were no longer included in MEPS starting on 2017, so those relationships no longer appear in any of the categories.

Parent Identifiers  
The variables MOPID31X, MOPID42X, MOPID53X and  DAPID31 X, DAPI D42X, DAPID53X 
are round-specific and are used to identify the parents (biological, adopted, or step) of the person 
represented on that record. MOPID##X contains the person identifier (PID) for each individual’s 
mother if she lived in the RU in that panel/round of the survey, or a value of -1 “ Inapplicable” if 
she did not. Similarly, DAPID##X contains the person identifier (PID) for each individual’ s 
father if he lived in the RU in that panel/round of the survey, or a value of -1 “Inapplicable” if he 
did not. MOPID##X and DAPID##X were constructed based on information collected in the 
relationship grid of the instrument each round at question RE900, and include biological, 
adopted, and stepparents. Foster parents were not included. For persons who were not present in 
the household during a round, MOPID##X and DAPID##X have values of -1 “Inapplicable”. 
Edits were performed to ensure that MOPID##X and DAPID##X were consistent with each 
individual’s age, sex, and other relationships within the family. For instance, the sex of the 
parent must be consistent with the indicated relationship; mothers are at least 12 years older than 
the person and no more than 55 years older than the person; fathers are at least 12 years older 
than the person; each person has no more than one mother and no more than one father; and the 
PID for the person’s mother and father are valid PIDs for that person’s RU for the 2020 Fu ll 
Year File.

2.5.4  Income and Tax Filing Variables ( FILEDR 20-HIEUIDX)  
The file provides income and tax- related variables that were constructed primarily from data 
collected in the Panel 23 Round 7, Panel 2 4 Round 5, and Panel 2 5 Round 3 Income sections. 
Person -level income amounts have been edited and imputed for every record on the full- year file, 
with detailed imputation flags provided as a guide to the method of editing. The tax- filing 
variables and some program participation variables are unedited, as discussed below. Beginning with the income data collected for Panel 21 Round 5 and Panel 22 Round 3, two skip 
patterns were introduced to reduce respondent burden. Prior to Panel 21 Round 5 and Panel 22 Round 3, unemployment compensation income (IN360) was asked of all respondents eligible for income collection. Beginning with Panel 21 Round 5 and Panel 22 Round 3, IN360 was not administered for respondents who reported employment at the same current main job in the current round and the previous two rounds. Similarly, prior to Panel 21 Round 5 and Panel 22 Round 3, alimony income (IN170) was collected for all respondents eligible for income collection. Beginning with Panel 21 Round 5 and Panel 22 Round 3, IN170 was not administered for respondents who were married in the current round and married in the previous two rounds. As detailed below, weighted, sequential hot-decks were used to estimate amounts for unemployment compensation (UNEMP20X) and alimony income (ALIMP20X) for these  
respondents. Users should note that the introduction of these skip patterns may affect comparability of these income measures across survey years.  
During imputation, logical editing and weighted, sequential hot- decks were used to estimate 
income amounts for missing values (both for item nonresponse and for persons in the full- year 
file who were not in the income rounds). Reported income components were generally left 
unedited (with the few exceptions noted below). Thus, analysts using these data may wish to 
apply additional checks for outlier values that would appear to stem from misreporting. 
The editing process began with wage and salary income, WAGEP20X. Complete responses were 
left unedited, and this group of people was assigned WAGIMP20=1, where WAGIMP20 is the imputation flag for wage and salary data. The only exception was for a small number of persons who reported zero wage and salary income despite having been employed for pay during the year according to round- level data (see below). Data on tax filing and on taxable income sources were 
collected using an approach that encouraged respondents to provide information from their federal tax returns. Logical edits as well as a specific question on the wage income of the

respondent (IN110) w
ere used to assign separate income amounts to married persons whose 
responses were based on combined income amounts on their joint tax returns. 
Persons assigned WAGIMP20 =2 were those providing broad income ranges (brackets) rather 
than giving specific dollar amounts. Weighted sequential hot-decking was used to provide these 
individuals with specific dollar amounts. For this imputation, donors were persons who reported specific dollar amounts within the corresponding broad income ranges. In 2020 (as in all previous years)  there were a small number of cases where WAGEP20X=0 and WAGIMP20=2. 
These are cases where a married couple filing jointly reported wages with a bracket, and reported that one spouse earned $0 of that bracketed amount. All WAGEP20 X hot-deck imputations used 
cells defined on the basis of a conventional list of person- level characteristics including age, 
education, employment status, race, sex, and region.  
Perso ns assigned WAGIMP20 =3 were those who did not report wage and salary income and 
who were assigned WAGEP20 X=0 based on not having been employed during the year. 
Persons assigned WAGIMP20 =4 were those who did not provide valid dollar amounts or dollar 
ranges, but for whom we had related information from the employment sections of the survey. In 
most cases this information included wages, hours, and weeks worked; for some persons, only hours and weeks worked data were reported in the employment section. The available employment section data were used to construct annualized wage amounts to be used in place of missing income section annual wage and salary data. Comparisons of reported and constructed wages and salaries using persons who provided both sorts of information yielded a high degree of confidence that employment data could be reliably used to derive values to serve in place of missing wage and salary information. To implement this approach, part- year responders were 
assumed to be fully employed during the remainder of the year if they were employed during the period in which they provided data. An e xception was made for those who either died or were 
institutionalized. These persons were assigned zero wages and salaries for the time they were not in MEPS.  
Hot-deck imputation was used for the remaining persons with missing WAGEP 20X. Donor 
pools included persons whose WAGEP20X amounts were edited in the steps described above. Whenever possible, the hot-deck imputations used data on whether or not the person had been employed at any point during the year (and, if available, the number of weeks worked). Imputations for persons deemed to have been employed were conditional in nature, using only 
donors with positive WAGEP20X amounts (WAGIMP 20=5). Imputations for WAGEP20X for 
the remaining persons were unconditional, using both workers and non-workers as donor s 
(WAGIMP 20=6).  
After editing WAGEP 20X for all persons in the full- year file, the remaining income sources 
were edited in the following sequence: INTRP20X, BUSNP 20X, DIVDP 20X, ALIMP 20X, 
SALEP 20X, TRSTP 20X, PENSP 20X, IRASP 20X, SSECP20X, UNEMP 20X, WCMPP 20X, 
VETSP 20X, CASHP 20X, OTHRP 20X, CHLDP 20X, SSIP 20X, and PUBP20X. Income 
components were edited sequentially, in each case using information regarding income amounts that had already been edited (so as to maintain patterns of correlation across income sources whenever possible). In all cases, bracketed responses were edited first (using hot-deck imputations from donors in corresponding brackets who gave specific dollar amounts), followed 
 C-34 MEPS HC -224 
 


================================================================================
PÁGINA 43
================================================================================

by imputations for remaining missing values. The hot-deck imputations used cells defined on the 
basis of income amounts already edited and a conventional list of person- level characteristics 
such as age, education, employment status, race, sex, and region. In addition, hot- deck 
imputations for CHLDP 20X used family -level information concerning marital status and the 
number of children. Hot-deck imputations for SSIP20X and PUBP 20X were also assigned using, 
in part, simulated program eligibility indicators that integrated state -level program eligibility 
criteria with data on family composition and income. 
In the hot-decks for some income types, information from the National Health Interview Survey 
(NHIS) was used. The NHIS sample is the frame for the new sample selected for MEPS collection each year, with a year’s time lag. Data from  the 2017 NHIS correspond to MEPS 
Panel 2 3, while those from the 2018 NHIS correspond to MEPS Panel 24 Because MEPS units 
come from the NHIS, it is possible to match individual MEPS responding units to an NHIS unit.  
Taking advantage of this matching abili ty, income recipiency indicators collected by NHIS were 
used in imputing for missing data in certain MEPS income components - interest, dividends, 
business income, pensions, and Social Security. (Not all MEPS income categories have an equivalent in NHIS. A lso, wage data were available from NHIS, but were not used in the MEPS 
imputation process.) 
In cases where data on a particular income category were missing for a person in MEPS, the 
indicator in that income category on the NHIS file was employed, if a valid response was supplied. Indicators were examined for the entire tax-filing unit (two people in the case of married couples filing jointly; one person in all other cases). 
Reported income amounts of less than one dollar were treated as missing amounts (to be hot-
decked from donors with positive amounts of the corresponding income source). Also, very few cases of outlier responses were edited (primarily public sources of income that exceeded possible amounts). Otherwise, reported amounts were left unchanged. 
For each income component, the corresponding xxxIMP20 variable contains an indicator 
concerning the method for editing/imputation. All the flag variables have the following formatted values:  
1 = Original response used; 
2 = Bracket converted;  
3 = Missing value set to 0; 
4 = Weeks worked/earnings used (WAGIMP20 only); 
5 = Conditional hot- deck;  
6 = Unconditional hot-deck; 
Missing values were set to zero when there were too few recipients to warrant hot -deck 
imputations of positive values (as in the case of ALIMP 20X received by males). “Conditional

hot-decks” indica
te instances where the respondent indicated receipt but not a specific dollar 
amount. In these cases, the donor pool was restricted to persons with nonzero amounts of the 
income source in question. “Unconditional hot-decks” indicate instances where the donor pool included persons receiving both zero and nonzero amounts (implemented in cases where there was little or no information about a person’s income source).  
Total person- level income (TTLP 20X)  is the sum of all income components with the exception 
of SALEP 20X (to match as closely as possible the CPS definitio n of income; see Section 2.5.4). 
Some researchers may wish to define their own income measure by adding in one or both of 
these excluded components.  
The tax variables and food stamp variables are all completely unedited. Unedited tax variables 
are provided to assist researchers buildi ng tax simulation programs. No efforts have been made 
to eliminate inconsistencies among these program participation and tax variables and other MEPS data. All of these unedited variables should be used with great care. 
Income Top -Coding  
All person- level i ncome amounts on the file, including both total income and the separate 
sources of income, were top-coded to preserve confidentiality. For each income source, top codes were applied to the top percentile of all cases (including negative amounts that exceeded income thresholds in absolute value). In cases where less than one percent of all persons received a particular income source, all recipients were top -coded. 
Top-coded income amounts were masked using a regression -based approach. The regressions 
relied on many of the same variables used in the hot-deck imputations, with the dependent variable in each case being the natural logarithm of the amount that the income component was in excess of its top -code threshold. Predicted values from this regression were reconverted from 
logarithms to levels using a smearing correction, and these predicted amounts were then added back to the top-code thresholds. This approach preserves the component- by-component weighted 
means (both overall and among top-coded cases), while also preserving much of the income distribution conditional on the variables contained in the regressions. At the same time, this approach ensures that every reported amount in excess of its respective threshold is altered on the public use file. The process of top-coding income amounts in this way inevitably introduces measurement error in cases where income amounts were reported correctly by respondents. Note, however, that top-coding can also help to reduce the impact of outliers that occur due to reporting errors.  
Total person-level income is constructed as the sum of the adjusted person- level income 
components. Having constructed total income in this manner, this total was then top-coded using the same regression -based procedure described above (again masking the top percentile of 
cases). Finally, the components of income were scaled up or down in order to make the sources of income consistent with the newly- adjusted totals.

Poverty Status  
The definitions of income, family, and poverty categories used to construct the related variables 
in this file were taken from the 20 20 poverty statistics developed by the Current Population 
Survey (CPS). The categorical variable for 2020 family income as a percentage of poverty 
(POVCAT 20) was constructed using the s ame method as in earlier years’ files.  
FAMINC 20 contains total family income for each person’s CPS family. Family income was 
derived by constructing person-level total income comprising annual earnings from wages, salaries, bonuses, tips, commissions; business and farm gains and losses; unemployment and workers’ compensation; interest and dividends; alimony, child support, and other private cash transfers; private pensions, IRA withdrawals, social security, and veterans payments; supplemental security income and cash welfare payments from public assistance, and related programs; gains or losses from estates, trusts, partnerships, S corporations, rent, and royalties; and a small amount of “other” income. Person- level income excluded tax refunds and capital 
gains. Person- level income totals were then summed over family members, as defined by 
CPSFAMID, to yield CPS family -level total income (FAMINC 20).  
POVLEV 20 is the continuous version of the POVCAT20 variable. The POVLEV 20 percentage 
was computed by dividing CPS family income by the applicable poverty line (based on family size and composition). POVCAT20 takes the POVLEV 20 percentage for each person and 
classifies it into one of five poverty categories: negative or poor (less than 100%), near poor (100% to less than 125%), low income (125% to less than 200%), middle income (200% to less than 400%), and high income (greater than or equal to 400%). Persons missing CPSFAMID were treated as one-person families in constructing their poverty percentage and category.  
Family income, as well as the components of person-level income, has been subjected to internal 
editing patterns and derivation methods that are in accordance to specific definitions, and are not being released at this time. Researchers working with a family definition other than CPSFAMID may wish to create their own versions of total family income. 
Health Insurance Eligibility Units (HIEUs) are sub -family relationship units constructed to 
include adults plus those family members who would typically be eligible for coverage under the 
adults' private health insurance family plans. To construct the HIEUIDX variable, which links persons into a common HIEU, we begin with the family identification variable CPSFAMID. Working with this family ID, we define HIEUID X using family relationships as of the end of 
2020. Persons missing end-of-year relationship information are assigned to an HIEUIDX using relationship information from the last round in which they provided such information. HIEUs comprise adults, their spouses, and their unmarried natural/adoptive children age 18 and under. Prior to the 2018 data year, only opposite- sex spouses were eligible to be included in the same 
HIEU. Beginning with the 2018 data year, both same-sex and opposite- sex spouses are included 
in the same HIEU. We also include children under age 24 who are full- time students (living at 
home or away from home). Other children who do not live with their natural/adoptive adult parents are placed in an HIEUIDX as follows:  
• Other unmarried children are placed in stepparent HIEUIDX, grandparent HIEUIDX, great -grandparent HIEUIDX, or aunt/uncle HIEUIDX.

HIEUIDX of their adult grandparents (if possible). Married minors are placed into separate HIEUs along with any spouses and children they might have.  
• Some HIEUs are headed by unmarried minors, when there is no adult family member present in the CPSFAMID.  
HIEUs do not, in general, comprise adult (nonmarital) partnerships, because unmarried adult partners are rarely eligible for dependent coverage under each other's insurance. The exception to this rule is that we include adult partners in the same HIEU if there is at least one (out-of- wedlock) child in the family that links  to both adult partners. In cases of missing or 
contradictory relationship codes, HIEUs are edited by hand, with the presumption being that the adults and children form a nuclear family. 
2.5.5  Person -Level Condition Variables (RTHLTH31 -ADHDAGED ) 
Perceived Health Status  
Perceived health status (RTHLTH31, RTHLTH42, and RTHLTH53) and perceived mental 
health status (MNHLTH31, MNHLTH42, and MNHLTH53) were collected in the Priority Conditions Enumeration (PE) section. The target persons of the questions are all c urrent or 
institutionalized persons regardless of age. These questions (PE10 and PE20) asked the respondent to rate each person in the family according to the following categories: excellent, very good, good, fair, and poor. For Panel 23, RTHLTH31 and MNHLTH31 contain the same values as RTHLTH42 and MNHLTH42 respectively.  
Priority Condition Variables (HIBPDX -ADHDAGED) 
The PE section was asked in its entirety in Round 1 for all current or institutionalized persons, and in Panel 25 Round 2, Panel 24 Round 4, and Panel 23 Round 6 for only new RU members. In Panel 25 Round 3 and Panel 24 Round 5, the specific condition questions (except joint pain and chronic bronchitis) were asked only if the person had not reported the condition in a previous round. (Note, these questions were not asked of Panel 23 Round 5 persons). Round 5 PE questions were added to CAPI beginning in Panel 24 Round 5 to collect additional data to offset the decrease in the number of cases in the FY 20 data related to lower expected sample y ields for 
Panel 25 because of the COVID -19 pandemic. 
Priority condition variables whose names end in “DX” indicate whether the person was ever diagnosed with the condition. Chronic bronchitis, joint pain, and asthma follow-up questions (ASSTIL31 /53, ASATAK31/53, and ASTHEP31/53 described below) reflect data obtained in 
Round 7 of Panel 23, Rounds 3 and 5 of Panel 2 4, and Rounds 1 and 3 of Panel 2 5. Diagnoses 
data (except attention deficit hyperactivity disorder/attention deficit disorder, diabetes, and asthma) were collected for persons over 17 years of age. If edited age is within range for the 
variable to be set, but the source data are missing because person’s age in CAPI is not within range, the constructed variable is set to “Cannot be Computed” (-15). Following the same 
pattern, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder/attention deficit disorder is asked of persons age 5

to 17, and diabetes and asthma are asked of persons of all ages. Exceptions to this pattern are the 
variables JTPAIN31_M18 and CHBRON31, which are described in greater detail below.  
Questions were asked regarding the following conditions: 
• High blood pressure, including multiple diagnoses 
• Heart disease (including coronary heart disease, angina, myocardial infarction, and 
other unspecifie d heart disease)  
• Stroke 
• Emphysema  
• Chronic bronchitis 
• High cholesterol 
• Cancer  
• Diabetes  
• Joint pain  
• Arthritis  
• Asthma  
• Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder/Attention Deficit Disorder (ADHD/ADD)  
These conditions were selected because of their relatively high  prevalence, and because 
generally accepted standards for appropriate clinical care have been developed. This information thus supplements other information on medical conditions that is gathered in other parts of the interview.  
Condition data were collected at the person -by-round level (indicating if the person was ever 
diagnosed with the condition) and at the condition level. If the person reported having been diagnosed with a condition, the person- by-round variable was set to ‘1’ (Yes) and a condition 
record for that medical condition was created. 
Editing of these variables focused on checking that skip patterns were consistent. 
High Blood Pressure  
Questions about high blood pressure (hypertension) were asked only of persons aged 18 or older. 
Consequently, persons aged 17 or younger were coded as “Inapplicable” (-1) on these variables. HIBPDX ascertained whether the person had ever been diagnosed as having high blood pressure (other than during pregnancy). Those who had received this diagnosis were also asked if they had been told on two or more different visits that they had high blood pressure (BPMLDX). The

age of diagnosis for high blood pressure (HIBPAGED) is included in this file. This variable is 
top-coded to 85 years of age. 
Heart Disease  
Heart disease questions were asked only of persons aged 18 or older. Consequently, persons aged 
17 or younger were coded as “Inapplicable” (- 1) on all the variables in this set.  
CHDDX - asked if the person had ever been diagnosed as having coronary heart disease  
ANGIDX - asked if the person had ever been diagnosed as having angina, or angina pectoris  
MIDX - asked if the person had ever been diagnosed as having a heart attack, or myocardial infarction  
OHRTDX - asked if the person had ever been diagnosed with any other kind of heart disease or condition 
The age of diagnosis for coronary heart disease (CHDAGED), angina (ANGIAGED), heart attack or myocardial infarction (MIAGED), and other kind of heart disease (OHRTAGED) are included in this file. These variables are top-coded to 85 years of age. 
Respondents who answered “Yes” to a person being diagnosed with any other kind of heart 
disease or condition (OHRTDX) were asked a follow up question (OHRTTYPE) to specify other heart diseases or conditions. 
Stroke  
STRKDX asked if the person (aged 18 or older) had ever been diagnosed as having had a stroke 
or transient ischemic attack (TIA or ministroke). Persons aged 17 or younger were coded as “Inapplicable” ( -1). The age of diagnosis for stroke or TIA (STRKAGED) is included in this file. 
This variable is top -coded to 85 years of age. 
Emphysema  
EMPHDX asked if the person (aged 18 or older) had ever been diagnosed with emphysema. Persons aged 17 or younger were coded as “Inapplicable” (-1). The age of diagnosis for emphysema (EMPHAG ED) is included in this file. This variable is top -coded to 85 years of age. 
Chronic Bronchitis  
CHBRON31 asked if the person (aged 18 or older) has had chronic bronchitis in the last 12 months. Persons aged 17 or younger were coded as “Inapplicable” (-1).  
High Cholesterol  
Questions about high cholesterol were asked of persons aged 18 or older. Consequently, persons 
aged 17 or younger were coded as “Inapplicable” (- 1) on these variables. CHOLDX ascertained 
whether the person had ever been diagnosed as having high cholesterol. The age of diagnosis for high cholesterol (CHOLAGED) is included in this file. This variable is top -coded to 85 years of 
age.

Cancer  
Questions about cancer were asked only of persons aged 18 or older. Consequently, persons aged 
17 or younger were coded as “Inapplicable” ( -1) on these variables. CANCERDX ascertained 
whether the person had ever been diagnosed as having cancer or a malignancy of any kind. If the respondent answered “Yes” they were asked at PE140 what type of cancer was diag nosed. 
CABLADDR, CABLOOD, CABREAST, CACERVIX, CACOLON, CALUNG, CALYMPH, CAMELANO, CAMUSCLE, CAOTHER, CAPROSTA, CASKINNM, CASKINDK, and CAUTERUS indicate selection of cancer of the bladder, blood, breast, cervix, colon, or lung; lymphoma or melanoma; cancer  of the soft tissue, muscle, or fat; other type of cancer, cancer of 
the prostate, skin, or uterus. Cancer of the cervix or uterus could not be reported for males, and cancer of the prostate could not be reported for females.  
Recoding of Cancer Variables  
Specific cancer diagnosis variables with a frequency count fewer than 20 and those considered clinically rare (i.e., appear on the National Institutes of Health’s list of rare diseases), were removed from the file for confidentiality reasons, and the corresponding variable CAOTHER, indicating diagnosis of a cancer that is not counted individually, was recoded to “Yes” (1) as necessary.  
In data year 20 20, the clinically rare cancers are:  
• bone 
• brain  
• esophagus 
• gallbladder  
• kidney 
• larynx  • leukemia  
• liver 
• mouth 
• ovary 
• pancreas  
• rectum  • stomach  
• testis  
• throat 
• thyroid  
The variable CABREAST, which indicates diagnosis of breast cancer, was recoded to “Inapplicable” ( -1) for males for confidentiality reasons. The corresponding value of the gen eral 
cancer diagnosis variable, CANCERDX, was recoded to “Cannot be Computed” (-15), and the corresponding values of remaining specific cancer variables were recoded to “Inapplicable” ( -1). 
Diabetes  
Prior to 2018, diabetes diagnosis was asked for each person aged 18 or older. Beginning in 2018, DIABDX_M18 replaces DIABDX where diabetes is now asked for all ages. DIABDX_M18 indicates whether each person had ever been diagnosed with diabetes (excluding gestational diabetes). The age of diagnosis for diabetes (DIABAGED) is included in this file. This variable is top -coded to 85 years of age. 
Each person 18 years or older said to have received a diagnosis of diabetes was asked to complete a special self -administered questionnaire. The documentation for this questionnaire 
appears in the Diabetes Care Survey (DCS) section of the documentation.

Joint Pain  
JTPAIN31 _M18 
asked if the person (aged 18 or older) had experienced pain, swelling, or stiffness 
around a joint in the last 12 months. This question is not intended to be used as an indicator of a 
diagnosis of arthritis. Persons aged 17 or younger were coded as “Inapplicable” (- 1). 
Joint pain questions are skipped if the person already has an arthritis condition that is specified on the conditions roster in the PE section.  
Arthritis  
ARTHDX asked if the person (aged 18 or older) had ever been diagnosed with arthritis. Persons 
aged 17 or younger were coded as “Inapplicable” (- 1). Respondents who answered “Yes” were 
asked a follow up question to determine the type of arthritis. ARTHTYPE indicates if the diagnosis was for Rheumatoid Arthritis (1), Osteoarthritis (2), or non- specific arthritis (3). The 
age of diagnosis for arthritis (ARTHAGED) is included in this file and may be recoded in some cases to “Cannot be Comput ed” ( -15) for confidentiality reasons. This variable is top-coded to 85 
years of age.  
Asthma  
ASTHDX indicates whether a person had ever been diagnosed with asthma. The age of diagnosis for asthma (ASTHAGED) is included in this file. This variable is top-coded to 85 years of age. 
Respondents who answered “Yes” to asthma diagnosis were asked additional questions. 
ASSTIL31 asked if the person still had asthma. ASATAK31 asked whether the person had experienced an episode of asthma or an asthma attack in t he past 12 months. If the person did not 
experience an asthma attack in the past 12 months, a follow-up question (ASTHEP31) asked when the last asthma episode or asthma attack occurred.  
Additional follow-up questions regarding asthma medication used for quick relief (ASACUT31), 
preventive medicine (ASPREV31), and peak flow meters (ASPKFL31) were asked. These questions were asked if the person reported having been diagnosed with asthma (ASTHDX = 1). ASACUT31 asked whether, during the last three months, the person had used the kind of prescription inhaler “that you breathe in through your mouth” that gives quick relief from asthma symptoms. ASPREV31 asked whether the person had ever taken the preventive kind of asthma medicine used every day to protect the lu ngs and prevent attacks, including both oral medicine 
and inhalers. ASPKFL31 indicates whether the person with asthma had a peak flow meter at home.  
Respondents who answered “Yes” to ASACUT31 were asked whether the person had used more 
than three canister s of this type of inhaler in the past three months (ASMRCN31). Respondents 
who answered “Yes” to ASPREV31 were asked whether the person now took this kind of medication daily or almost daily (ASDALY31). Respondents who answered “Yes” to ASPKFL31 were asked  if the person ever used the peak flow meter (ASEVFL31). Those 
respondents who answered “Yes” to ASEVFL31 were asked when the person last used the peak flow meter (ASWNFL31).  
Beginning in 2018, questions regarding asthma medication used for quick relief, preventive medicine, and peak flow meters are now implemented starting with Panel 22 Round 3 and

 ASWNFL31 (When Last Used Peak Flow Meter - RD 3/1)  ASWNFL 53 (When La st Used Peak Flow Meter - RD 5/3 ) 
It may appear that there are discrepancies between the diagnosis variable and the follow -up 
variables. If a person reported asthma in the PE section in Panel 25 Round 3, ASATAK31 and 
ASSTIL31 will be set to “Inapplicable” (-1) as the person had not reported asthma in Round 1.

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder/Attention Deficit Disorder  
ADHDADDX asked if persons aged 5 through 17 had ever been diagnosed as having Attention

hyperactivity disorder/attention deficit disorder (ADHDAGE D) is included in this file.  
2.5.6  Health Status Variables (IADLHP31 -ADOVER42 ) 
Due to the overlapping panel design of the MEPS (Round 3 for Panel 24 overlapped with Round 1 for Panel 25; Round 6 for Panel 23 coincided with Round 4 for Panel 24 and Round 2 for Panel 25; and Round 7 for Panel 23 occurred at the same time as Round 5 for Panel 24 and Round 3 for Panel 25), data from overlapping rounds have been combined across panels. In 
2020, data collection was expanded beyond five rounds. V ariables ending in “31” reflect data 
obtained in Round 3 of Panel 24 and Round 1 of Panel 25. Variables ending in “42” reflect data obtained in Round 6 of Panel 23, Round 4 of Panel 24 and Round 2 of Panel 25. Variables ending in “53” reflect data obtained in Round 7 of Panel 23, Round 5 of Panel 24 and Round 3 of Panel 25. Health Status variables whose names end in “20” indicate a full -year measurement.  For 
persons in Panel 24, Round 3 extended from 2019 into 2020. Therefore, for these people, some information from late 201 9 is included for variables that have names ending in “31”. 
Health variables were not collected in Panel 23 Round 5, so “31” health variables for Panel 23 were constructed to -15. For these “31” health measures, data were not collected in the Panel 23 
Round 6 interview and, therefore, Round 6 data were not available to fill Round 5 variables. 
Health Status variables in this data release can be classified into several conceptually distinct 
sets: 
• IADL (Instrumental Activities of Daily Living) and ADL (Activities of Daily Living) limitations  
• Functional and activity limitations  
• Hearing, vision problems 
• Disability statu s 
• Any limitations  
• Child health and preventive care 
• Additional health  
• Self-administered questionnaire 
• Diabetes care survey

In general, H
ealth Statu s variables involved the construction of person- level variables based on 
information collected in the Health Status section of the questionnaire. Many Health Status 
questions were initially asked at the family level to ascertain if anyone in the household had a particular problem or limitation. These were followed up with questions to determine which household member had each problem or limitation. All information ascertained at the family level has been brought to the person level for this file. Logical edits were performed in constructing the person- level variables to assure that family -level and person -level values were 
consistent. Particular attention was given to cases where missing values were reported at the family level to ensure that appropriate inf ormation was carried to the person level. 
Inapplicable cases occurred when a question was never asked because of a skip pattern in the survey (e.g., some follow-up verification questions were not asked about individuals who were 13 years of age or older; questions pertaining to children’s health status were not asked about individuals older than 17). Inapplicable cases are coded as -1. In addition, deceased persons were coded as “Inapplicable” ( -1). 
Each of the sets of variables listed above will be describ ed in turn. 
IADL and ADL Limitations  
IADL Help  
The Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) Help or Supervision variable IADLHP31  
was constructed from a series of three questions administered in the Health Status sect ion of the 
interview in Panel 2 4 Round 3 and Panel 25 Round 1. Eligible persons in Panel 23 were 
constructed to -15. These data were not collected in either Panel 23 Round 5 or Panel 23 Round 6. 
In 2020, the IADL questions were also administered in Panel 23 Round 7, Panel 24 Round 5, and 
Panel 25 Round 3 and the new variable IADLHP53 is included in this file.  The initial question (HE10) determined if anyone in the family received help or supervision with 
IADLs such as using the telephone, paying bills, taking medications, preparing light meals, doing laundry, or going shopping. If the response was “Yes”, a follow-up question (HE20) was asked to determine which household member(s) received this help or supervision. For persons 
under age 13, a final verification question (HE30) was asked to confirm that the IADL help or 
supervision was the result of an impairment or physical or mental health problem. If the response to the final verification question was “No”, IADLHP31 or IADLHP53 was coded “No” for 
persons under the age of 13. 
If no one in the family was identified as receiving help or supervision with IADLs, all members 
of the family were coded as receiving no IADL help or supervision. In cases where the response to the family -level question was “Refused” ( -7), “Don’t Know” (-8), or “Cannot be Computed” 
(-15), all persons were coded according to the family- level r esponse. In cases where the response 
to the family -level question (HE10) was “Yes” but no specific individuals were identified in the 
follow-up question as having IADL difficulties, all persons were coded as “Don’t Know” (- 8).

ADL Help  
The Activities of Da ily Living (ADL) Help or Supervision varia ble ADLHLP31 was constructed 
in the same manner, and for the same persons, as the IADL help variable, but using questions 
HE40 -HE60 in Panel 24 Round 3 and Panel 25 Round 1. Eligible persons in Panel 23 were 
constructed to -15. These data were not collected in either Panel 23 Round 5 or Panel 23 Round 6.  
In 2020, the ADL questions were also administered in Panel 23 Round 7, Panel 24 Round 5, and 
Panel 25 Round 3 and the new variable ADLHLP53 is included in this fil e. Coding conventions 
for missing data were the same as for the IADL variable.  
Functional and Activity Limitations  
A series of health status questions was asked related to functional limitations; use of assistive technology and social/recreational limitations; work, housework, and school limitations; and cognitive limitations. The ‘31’ versions of these variables incorporate data collected in Panel 24 Round 3 and Panel 25 Round 1. Eligible persons in Panel 23 were constructed to -15. T hese data 
were not collected in either Panel 23 Round 5 or Panel 23 Round 6.  
The ‘53’ versions of these variables (new in 2020) incorporate data collected in Panel 23 
Round 7, Panel 24 Round 5, and Panel 25 Round 3. 
Functional Limitations  
A series of ques tions was  asked that  pertained to functional limitations, which are defined as 
difficulty in performing certain specific physical actions. WLKLIM31 /53 was the filter question. 
These variables were derived from a question (HE90) that was asked at the family level: “Does 
anyone in the family have difficulties walking, climbing stairs, grasping objects, reaching overhead, lifting, bending or stooping, or standing for long periods of time?” If the answer was “No”, then all family members were coded as “No” (2) on WLKLIM31 /53. If th e answer was 
“Yes”, then the specific persons who had any of these difficulties were identified and coded as “Yes” (1), and remaining family members were coded as “No” (2) . If the response to the 
family -level question was “Don’t Know” (- 8), “Refused” ( -7), “Cannot be Computed” (-15), or 
“Inapplicable” ( -1), then the corresponding missing value code was applied to each family 
member’s value for WLKLIM31/53. If the answer to HE90 was “Yes” (1) but no specific individual was named as experiencing such difficul ties, then each family member was assigned 
“Don’t Know” (- 8). Deceased persons were assigned a code of “Inapplicable” ( -1) for 
WLKLIM31 /53. 
If WLKLIM31 /53 was coded “Yes” (1) for any family member, a subsequent series of questions 
was administered. The ser ies of questions for which WLKLIM31/53 served as a filter is as 
follows: 
LFTDIF31 /53 - difficulty lifting 10 pounds 
STPDIF31 /53 - difficulty walking up 10 steps 
WLKDIF31 /53 - difficulty walking 3 blocks 
 C-46 MEPS HC -224 
 


================================================================================
PÁGINA 55
================================================================================

MILDIF31 /53 - difficulty walking a mile  
STNDIF31 /53 - difficulty standing 20 minutes 
BENDIF31 /53 - difficulty bending or stooping 
RCHDIF31 /53 - difficulty reaching over head  
FNGRDF31 /53 - difficulty using fingers to grasp  
This series of questions was asked separately for each person whose response to WLKLIM31/53 
was coded “Yes” (1). The series of questions was not asked for other individual family members whose response to WLKLIM31/53 was “No” (2). In addition, this series was not asked about family members who were less than 13 years of age, regardless of their status on WLKLIM31 /53. These questions were not asked about deceased family members. In such cases 
(i.e., WLKLIM31/53 = 2, or age < 13, or PSTATS31/53 = 23, 24, or 31), each question in the series was coded as “Inapplicable” ( -1). Finally, if responses to WLKLIM31/53 were “Refused” 
(-7), “Don’t Know” (-8), “Cannot be Computed” (-15), or otherwise “Inapplicable” (-1), then each question in this series was coded as “Inapplicable” ( -1). 
Analysts should note that WLKLIM31/53 was asked of all household membe rs, regardless of 
age. For the subsequent series of questions, however, persons less than 13 years old were skipped and coded as “Inapplicable” ( -1). Therefore, it is possible for someone age 12 or younger to have 
a code of “Yes” (1) on WLKLIM31/53, and also to have codes of “Inapplicable” on the subsequent series of questions. 
WLKLIM31, LFTDIF31, STPDIF31, WLKDIF31, MILDIF31, STNDIF31, BENDIF 31, 
RCHDIF 31 and FNGRDF31 were all coded “Cannot be Computed” (-15) for eligible persons in 
Panel 23 because these d ata were not collected in  Panel 23 Round 5 or Panel 23 Round 6. 
Use of Assistive Technology and Social/Recreational Limitations  
The variables indicating use of assistive technology (AIDHLP31/53 from question HE70) and 
social/recreational limitations (SOCLIM31 /53, from question HE230) were collected initially at 
the family level. If there was a “Yes” (1) response to the family -level question, a second question 
identified the specific individual(s ) to whom the “Yes” response pertained. Each individual 
identified as having the difficulty was coded “Yes” (1) for the appropriate variable; all remaining family members were coded “No” (2). If the family -level response was “Refused” ( -7), “Don’t 
Know” ( -8), or “Cannot be Computed” (-15), all persons were coded with the family- level 
response. In cases where the family -level response was “Yes” but no specific individual was 
identified as having difficulty, all family members were coded as “Don’t Know” (- 8). 
AIDHLP31 and SOCLIM31 were coded “Cannot be Computed” (-15) for eligible persons in Panel 23 because these data were not collected in Panel 23 Round 5 or Panel 23 Round 6. 
Work, Housework, and School Limitations  
The variable indicating any limitation in work, housework, or school (ACTLIM31/53) was 
constructed using questions HE190- HE200. Specifically, information was collected initially at 
the family level. If there was a “Yes” (1) response to the family -level question (HE190), a 
 C-47 MEPS HC -224 
 


================================================================================
PÁGINA 56
================================================================================

second question (HE200) ide
ntified the specific individual(s) to whom the “Yes” (1) response 
pertained. Each individual identified as having a limitation was coded “Yes” (1) for the 
appropriate variable; all remaining family members were coded “No” (2). If the family -level 
respons e was “Refused” ( -7), “Don’t Know” (-8), or “Cannot be Computed” (-15), all persons 
were coded with the family -level response. In cases where the family -level response was “Yes” 
(1) but no specific individual was identified as having limitation, all family  members were coded
as “Don’t Know” (- 8). Persons less than five years old were coded as “Inapplicable” ( -1) on
ACTLIM31 /53.
If ACTLIM31 /53 was “Yes” (1) and the person was 5 years of age or older, a follow-up question 
(HE210) was asked to identify the spe cific limitation or limitations for each person. These 
included working at a job (WRKLIM31/53), doing housework (HSELIM31/53), or going to school (SCHLIM31/53). Respondents could answer “Yes” (1) or “No” (2) to each activity; thus a person could report lim itations in multiple activities. WRKLIM31 /53, HSELIM31/53, and 
SCHLIM31 /53 have values of “Yes” (1) or “No” (2) only if ACTLIM31 /53 was “Yes” (1); each 
variable was coded as “Inapplicable” ( -1) if ACTLIM31 /53 was “No” (2). When ACTLIM31/53 
was “Refused” ( -7), these variables were all coded as “Refused” ( -7); when ACTLIM31/53 was 
“Don’t Know” (- 8), these variables were all coded as “Don’t Know” ( -8); and when 
ACTLIM31 /53 was “Cannot be Computed” (- 15), these variables were all coded as “Cannot be 
Computed” (-15). If a person was under 5 years old or was deceased, WRKLIM31/53, HSELIM31 /53, and SCHLIM31/53 were each coded as “Inapplicable” ( -1). 
An additional question (UNABLE31/53) asked if the person was completely unable to work at a job, do housework, or go to school. Those persons who were coded “No” (2), “Refused” (- 7), 
“Don’t Know” (-8), or “Cannot be Computed” (-15) on ACTLIM31/53, were under 5 years of age, or were deceased were coded as “Inapplicable” ( -1) on UNABLE31/53 . UNABLE31 /53 was 
asked once for whichever set of WRKLIM31/53, HSELIM31/53, and SCHLIM31/53 the person had limitations; if a person was limited in more than one of these three activities, UNABLE31 /53 
did not  specify if the person was completely unable to perform all of them, or only some of 
them.  
ACTLIM31, WRKLIM31, SCHLIM31, HSELIM31 and UNABLE31 were all coded “Cannot be Computed” (-15) for eligible persons in Panel 23 because th ese data were not collected in Panel 
23 Round 5 or Panel 23 Round 6. 
Cognitive Limitations  
The variable indicating any cognitive limitation (COGLIM31 /53) was collected at the family 
level as a three-part question (HE250A to HE250C), asking if any of the adults in the family (1) 
experience confusion or memory loss, (2) have problems making decisions, or (3) r equire 
supervision for their own safety. If a “Yes” response was obtained to any item, the persons affected were identified in HE260, and COGLIM31/53 was coded as “Yes” (1). Remaining family members not identified were coded as “No” (2) for COGLIM31 /53. 
If responses to HE250A through HE250C were all “No”, or if two of three were “No” (2) and the 
remaining was “Refused” ( -7), “Don’t Know” (-8), or “Cannot be Computed” (- 15), all family 
members were coded as “No” (2). If responses to the three questions were combinations of 
“Don’t Know” (- 8), “Refused” ( -7), and missing, all persons were coded as “Don’t Know” (-8).

If the response to a
ny of the three questions was “Yes” (1) but no individual was identified in 
HE260, all persons were coded as “Don’t Know” (- 8). 
COGLIM31 /53 reflects whether any of the three component questions is “Yes” (1). Family 
members with one, two, or three specific cognitive limitations cannot be distinguished. In 
addition, because the question asked specifically about adult family members, all persons less than 18 years of age are coded as “Inapplicable” ( -1) on this question. 
COGLIM31 was coded “Cannot be Computed” (-15) for eligible persons in Panel 23 because these data were not collected in Panel 23 Round 5 or Panel 23 Round 6. 
Hearing,  Vision Problems  
A series of questions (HE270 to HE310), asked in Panel 23 Round 6, Panel 2 4 Round 4, and 
Panel  25 Round 2, provides information on hearing and visual impairment. Household members 
less than one year old and deceased RU members were coded as “Inapplicable” (-1).  
The hearing impairment variable, DFHEAR42, indicates whether a person has serious difficulty 
hearing. This variable was based on two questions, HE270 and HE280. The initial question (HE270) determined if anyone in the family had dif ficulty hearing. If the response was “Yes” 
(1), a follow-up question (HE280) was asked to determine which household member(s) had a hearing impairment. If the family -level response was “Don’t Know” ( -8), “Refused” ( -7), or 
“Cannot be Computed” (-15), all persons were coded with the family -level response. In cases 
where the family -level response was “Yes” (1) but no specific individual was identified as 
having serious difficulty hearing, all family members were coded as “Don’t Know” (- 8).  
The visual impairment variable, DFSEE42, indicates whether a person has serious difficulty seeing. This variable was based on two questions, HE290C and HE300. The initial question (HE290C) determined if anyone in the family had difficulty seeing. If the response was “Yes” (1), a follow-up question (HE300) was asked to determine which household member(s) had a seeing impairment. If the family -level response was “Don’t Know” (- 8), “Refused” ( -7), or 
“Cannot be Computed” (-15), all persons were coded with the family- level respo nse. In cases 
where the family -level response was “Yes” (1) but no specific individual was identified as 
having serious difficulty seeing, all family members were coded as “Don’t Know” (- 8). 
Disability Status  
A series of questions (HE310 to HE380) in Panel  23 Round 6, Panel 2 4 Round 4, and Panel 2 5 
Round 2 provides information on cognitive difficulty, difficulty walking or climbing stairs, difficulty dressing or bathing, and difficulty doing errands. Questions regarding cognitive difficulty, difficulty walk ing or climbing stairs, and difficulty dressing or bathing were asked of 
household members 5 years of age and older. The question regarding difficulty doing errands was asked of household members 15 years of age and older. Deceased RU members were coded “Inapplicable” ( -1). 
DFCOG42 indicates whether a person had serious cognitive difficulty. This variable was based on two questions, HE310 and HE320. The initial question (HE310) determined if anyone in the family had difficulty concentrating, remembering or making decisions. If the response was “Yes”

(1), a follow-up que
stion (HE320) was asked to determine which household member(s) had 
difficulty concentrating, remembering or making decisions. If the family- level response was 
“Don’t Know” (- 8), “Refused” ( -7), or “Cannot be Computed” (-15), all persons were coded with 
the family -level response. In cases where the family -level response was “Yes” (1) but no specific 
individual was identified as having serious cognitive difficulty, all family members were coded 
as “Don’t Know” (- 8). 
DFWLKC42 indicates whether a person has serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs. This variable was based on two questions, HE330 and HE340. The initial question (HE330) determined if anyone in the family had serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs. If the response was “Yes” (1), a follow -up question (HE340) was asked to determine which household 
member(s) had difficulty walking or climbing stairs. If the family -level response was “Don’t 
Know” ( -8), “Refused” ( -7), or “Cannot be Computed” (-15), all persons were coded with the 
family -level response. In cases where the family -level response was “Yes” (1) but no specific 
individual was identified as having serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs, all family members were co ded as “Don’t Know” (- 8). 
DFDRSB42 indicates whether a person has difficulty dressing or bathing. This variable was based on two questions, HE350 and HE360. The initial question (HE350) determined if anyone in the family had difficulty dressing or bathing. If the response was “Yes” (1), a follow -up 
question (HE360) was asked to determine which household member(s) had difficulty dressing or bathing. If the family- level response was “Don’t Know” ( -8), “Refused” ( -7), or “Cannot be 
Computed” (-15), all persons were coded with the family -level response. In cases where the 
family -level response was “Yes” (1) but no specific individual was identified as having difficulty 
dressing or bathing, all family members were coded as “Don’t Know” (- 8). 
DFERND42 indicates whether a person has difficulty doing errands alone. This variable was based on two questions, HE370 and HE380. The initial question (HE370) determined if anyone in the family had difficulty doing errands alone. If the response was “Yes” (1), a follow-up question (HE380) was asked to determine which household member(s) had difficulty doing errands alone. If the family -level response was “Don’t Know” (-8), “Refused” (-7), or “Cannot 
be Computed” (-15), all persons were coded with the family-level response. In cases where the 
family -level response was “Yes” (1) but no specific individual was identified as having difficulty 
doing errands alone, all family members were coded as “Don’t Know” ( -8). 
Any Lim itation Rounds 6 and 7 (Panel 23)/ Rounds 3 , 4, and 5  (Panel 2 4) / Rounds 1 , 2, 
and 3  (Panel 2 5) 
ANYLMI 20 summarizes whether a person had any IADL, ADL, functional, or activity 
limitations in any of the pertinent rounds. ANYLMI 20 was built using the component variables 
IADLHP31 /53, ADLHLP31/53, WLKLIM31/53, ACTLIM31 /53, DFSEE42, and DFHEAR42. 
If any of these components was coded “Yes”, then ANYLMI 20 was coded “Yes” (1). If all 
component s were coded “No”, then ANYLMI 20 was coded “No” (2). If all the components were 
“Inapplicable” ( -1), then ANYLMI20 was coded as “Inapplicable” ( -1). If all the components 
had missing value codes (i.e., -7, -8, or -1), ANYLMI20 was coded as “Cannot be Computed” (-15). If some components were “No” and others had missing value codes, ANYLMI20 was coded as “Cannot be Computed” (-15). The exception to this latter rule was for children younger than

five years old, who were not asked questions that are the basis for ACTLIM31; for these RU 
members, if all other components were “No”, then ANYLMI20 was coded as “No” (2). For 
ANYLMI20, Panel 23 was constructed using the same logic described above but contains a higher frequency of “Cannot be Computed” (- 15) because the component variables were not 
collected in Panel 23 Round 5 or Panel 23 Round 6. The va riable label for ANYLMI 20 departs 
slightly from conventions. Typi cally, variables that end in “20” refer only to 2020. However, 
some of the variables used to construct ANYLMI 20 were assessed in 20 21, so some information 
from early 20 21 is incorporated into this variable. 
Child Health  and Preve ntive Care 
Questions were asked about each child (under the age of 18 excluding deceased children) in the applicable age subgroups to which they pertained. For the Child Supplement variables, a code of “Inapplicable” ( -1) was assigned if a person was deceased, was not in the appropriate Round 2, 
4, 6, or was not in the applicable age subgroup as of the interview date. This public use dataset contains variables and frequency distributions from the Child Health and Preventive Care (CS) Section associated  with 7,775 children who were eligible for the CS  section . Children were 
eligible for this section when PSTATS42 was not equal to 23, 24, 31 (Deceased) and 0 <= AGE42X <= 17. Of these children, 5,765 w ere assigned a positive person- level weight for 
2020 (P ERWT20 F > 0). Cases not eligible for the CS  section should be excluded from estimates 
made with the CS  section .  
Starting in 2018, the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) and Columbia Impairment Scale (CIS) series of questions will be administered every other year. CAPI will administer the CAHPS and CIS series as follows: 
• In Rounds 2 and 6 for panels whose Round 1 collection occurred in an odd year
• In Round 4 for panels whose Round 1 collection occurred in an even year
Therefore, since Panel 25 Round 1 collection started in 2020, Panel 24 Round 1 collection 
started in 2019, and Panel 23 Round 1 collection started in 2018, the CAHPS and CIS questions 
were not asked, and these variables are not included in the 2020 dataset . 
In addition, the child preventive care series will be administered every other year beginning in 
2018. CAPI will administer the child preventive care series in Round s 2 and 6 for panels whose 
Round 1 collection occurred in an odd year, and in Round 4 for panels whose Round 1 collection occurred in an even year. Therefore, the child preventive care questions were asked in 2020 and are included in the 2020 dataset.  
The following table summarizes the data years in which the subsections of CS section are asked.

Children with Special Health Care Needs Screener (ages 0 - 17)  
The Children with Special Health Care Needs (CSHCN) Screener instrument was developed through a national collaborative process as part of the Child and Adolescent Health Measurement Initiative (CAHMI) coordinated by  the Foundation for Accountability. A key reference for this 
screener instrument is  Bethel et al (2002).  
These questions are asked about children ages 0-17. In general, the CSHCN screener identifies children with activity limitation or need or use of more  health care or other services than is usual 
for most children of the same age. When a response to a gate question was set to “No” (2), “Refused” ( -7), “Don’t Know” (-8), or “Cannot be Computed” (-15), follow- up variables based 
on the gate question were coded as “Inapplicable” ( -1).  
The variable CSHCN42 identifies children with special health care needs, and was created using the CSHCN screener questions according to the specifications in the reference above. The CSHCN screener questions consist of a series of question sequences about the following five health consequences: the need or use of medicines prescribed by a doctor; the need or use of more medical care, mental health, or education services than is usual for most children; being limited or prevente d in doing things most children can do; the need or use of special therapy such 
as physical, occupational, or speech therapy; and the need or use of treatment or counseling for emotional, developmental, or behavioral problems. Parents who responded “yes” t o any of the 
“initial” questions in the five  question sequences were then asked to respond to up to two 
follow-up questions about whether the health consequence was attributable to a medical, behavioral, or other health condition lasting or expected to last at least 12 months. Children with positive responses to at least one of the five health consequences along with all of the follow-up questions were identified as having a Special Health Care Need. Children with a “no” response for all five  question seque nces were considered NOT to have a Special Health Care Need. Those 
children whose “special health care need” status could not be determined (due to missing data for any of the questions) were coded as “Unknown” for CSHCN42. More information about the CSHCN screener questions
 ca n be obtained from the website for the Child and Adolescent 
Health Measurement Initiative.  
Th
e CSHCN screener questions were:  
CHPMED42 -  child needs or uses prescribed medicines  
CHPMHB42 -  prescribed medicines were because of a medical, behavioral, or other health condition  
CHPMCN42 -  health condition that causes a person to need prescribed medicines has lasted or is expected to last  for at least 12 months

Child Preventive Care (age range depends on question)  
A series of questions was asked about amounts and types of preventive care a child may receive when going to see a doctor or other health provider. Questions are asked of children of different age groups depending on the nature of the questions. When a response to a gate question was set to “No” (2), “Refused” ( -7), “Don’t Know” (-8), or “Cannot be Computed” (-15), follow-up 
variables based on the gate question were coded as “Inapplicable” (- 1). Variables in this set 
include:

Beginning in 2001, due to confidentiality concerns and restrictions, child height and weight variables are not included on the Full- Year file. Instead, a Body Mass Index (BMI) variable, 
CHBMIX42 is used. For the 2001 and 2002 PUFs, CHBMIX42 was included for children ages 3-17; all children age 2 and under were given a -1 “Inapplicable” code. Starting with the 2003 
PUF, CHBMIX42 is included for all children ages 6-17; all children age 5 and under were given a -1 “Inapplicable” code.  
Please note: analysts can have access to the height and weight variables and/or can construct a BMI variable of their own through the AHRQ Data Center
.  
The steps used to c
alculate the BMI for children 6-17 are as follows: 
1. Construct child hei
ght and weight variables HGTFT42, HGTIN42, WGTLB42 based 
on collected data  
2. Create a preliminary data set containing height, weight, sex, and age data  
3. Generate a preliminary child BMI using the preliminary data set and the procedure for calculating the BMI for children as described on the  Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention website . 
4. Create the child BMI variable CHBMIX42 using the preliminary child BMI, setting all deceased persons, all persons over 17 years old, and all persons 5 years old or younger to Inapplicable (-1) 
As indicated in step 2 above, a preliminary SAS data set containing height, weight, sex, and age data for children 6-17 years old in FY 2020 was created. One SAS program and one SAS dataset were downloaded from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for the purpose of calculating the BMI for children (step 3). The program used the preliminary data set of children to generate a preliminary child BMI based on the 2000 CDC growth charts
. The 
program used the following formula to calculate the preliminary BMI for children:  
Weight in Kilograms
 / [(Height in Centimeters/100)]2 
Note that weight in pounds and ounces was converted to weight in kilograms in the preliminary data set. Similarly, height in feet and inches was converted to height in centimeters in the preliminary data set.

As indicated in ste
p 4 above, the child BMI variable CHBMIX42 was calculated using this 
preliminary BMI from step 3. Deceased persons, persons > 17 years old, and children younger 
than 6 years old were set to “Inapplicable” ( -1) for CHBMIX42. Children 6 -17 years old with a 
missing value for height in feet (HGTFT42 is “Refused” (-7), “Don’t Know” (-8), or “Cannot be Computed” (-15)) and/or weight in pounds (WGTLB42 is “Refused” (-7), “Don’t Know” (- 8), or 
“Cannot be Computed” (- 15)) were set to “Cann ot be Computed” (- 15) for CHBMIX42. 
Children whose height in feet was 0 and height in inches was missing (HGTIN42 is “Refused” (-7), “Don’t Know” (-8), or “Cannot be Computed” (-15)) wer e set to “Cannot be Computed” 
(-15) for CHBMIX42.  
Starting in 2020, CHBMIX42 is top-coded at 50 and bottom-coded at 10. CHBMIX42 was 
recoded to -15 (Cannot be Computed) for children with a height of less than 3 feet or greater than 8 feet.  
All other children 6-17 years old have a calculated BMI for FY 2020. 
Additional Healt h Variables 
LSTETH53 (has person lost all natural (permanent) teeth), PHYEXE53 (currently spends half hour or more in moderate to vigorous physical activity at least five times a week) , and 
OFTSMK53 (how often smoke cigarettes) are asked in the Additional Healthcare Questions (AH)  section . These questions are asked every year of each person 18 years or older. A code of 
“Inapplicable” ( -1) was assigned if the person was deceased or less than 18 years old. In 2020, 
these variables include data collected in Panel 23 Round 7. 
2020 Self -Administered Questionnaires 
The MEPS distributes several hard -copy, self -administered questionnaires (SAQs) to  collect 
health -related information from different subpopulations of MEPS participants. The Diabetes 
Care Survey is  distributed every year, while other SAQs are distributed only in select years. T he

Self-Administered Questionnaire (SAQ)  
The Self -Administered Questionnaire (SAQ ) is a paper -and-pencil questionna ire that includes 
core questions about health status, health care quality , and preventive health care measures of 
adults . In 2020, mental  health questions (MSAQ) were added to the SAQ .  
The preventive health questions are asked in alternating years and will be included in this file, 
and next in the 2022 SAQ. In 2019, questions regarding quality of health care, general health 
questions, and questions about health- related attitudes were asked  in the SAQ a nd will be 
included again in the 2021 SAQ.  
The 2020 SAQ was fielded during Panel 23 Round 6, Panel 24  Round 4, and Panel 2 5 Round 2 
of the 2020 MEPS  data collection .  
All adults age 18 and older as of the Round 2, 4, or 6  interview date (AGE42X >= 18) in MEPS 
households were asked to complete an SAQ. The questionnaires were administered in late 2020 
and early 20 21. 
There were two versions of the questionnaire; one administered to males and one to females. A variable representing the respondent’s sex, ADSEX42, is included on the file. Certain questions were administered in each of the questionnaires, depending on the respondent’s sex. Additionally, within each questionnaire there was a section asked only of those 50 years of age and older (ADAGE42 >= 50) ; this section also included certain questions based on the 
respondent’s sex. 
The variable SAQELIG indicates the person’s eligibility status for the SAQ. SAQELIG was used 
to construct the variables based on the SAQ data. SAQELIG was coded “0” (Not Eligible f or 
SAQ) if there was no record for the person in the round, if the person was deceased or institutionalized, moved out of the U.S., moved to a military facility, if the person’s disposition status was inapplicable, or if the person was less than 18 years old. SAQELIG was coded “1” (Eligible f or SAQ and Has SAQ Data) if an SAQ record existed for the person in Round 2 (for 
Panel 2 5), Round 4 (for Panel 2 4), or Round 6 (for Panel 23) . SAQELIG was coded “2” (Eligible 
for SAQ, but No SAQ Data) if no SAQ record existed for the person in the round. This variable 
was used as a building block for all other constructed SAQ variables. 
A question on the form asked if the respondent was the person represented in the form. If a 
person was unable to respond to the SAQ, the questionnaire was completed by a proxy. The relationship of the proxy to the adult represented in the questionnaire is indicated by the variable ADPROX42. Prior to 2015, the variable ADPRX42 indicated the relationship of the proxy to the adult. Starting in 2015, the response categories for proxy relationship were collapsed in a new variable ADPRXY42. ADPROX42 was coded “1” (Self-administered) if the respondent was the person represented in the questionnaire. A code of “- 1” (Inapplicable) was assigned if a pe rson 
was not eligible or was eligible but no data existed (SAQELIG = 0 or 2).  
If a person was not assigned a positive SAQ weight, all SAQ variables except  SAQELIG were 
coded “Inapplicable” ( -1). When a gate question answer was set to “No” (2), follow-up variables 
based on the gate question were coded as “Inapplicable” ( -1). When a gate question answer was 
set to “Refused” ( -7) or “Don’t Know” (-8), follow-up variable answers were left as reported. A

special weight variable (SAQWT20 F) has been designed to be used with the SAQ for persons 
who were age 18 and older at the interview date. This weight adjusts for non- response and 
weights to the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population (see Section 3.0 “Survey Sample 
Information” for details). The variables created from the SAQ begin with “AD,” again excepting SAQELIG.

______________________________
* The survey questions corresponding to the variables ADKALC42 
   and ADOFTALC42 changed from 2018 to 2020. In the 2018 Full-
   Year Consolidated file, the variable ADKALC42 was based on the 
   survey question: “In the last 12 months, has a doctor, nurse, or 
   other health care professional asked you how much and how  often you drink  alcohol?” In  the 2020 Full-Year Consolidated file, a different variable,  
   ADOFTALC42, reflects this same  question, while ADKALC42 is based on a new question: “How  often do you have a drink containing alcohol?” 
   Users should  be mindful of this change when utilizing the variable ADKALC42 in their analyse s for 2018, 2020, and beyond.

Height, Weight, and BMI  
Due to confidentiality concerns and restrictions, adult height and weight variables, ADHGTIN (Total height in inches) and ADWGHT42 (Weight without shoes), are not  included on t he 
Full-Year file . If the weight of the adult was set to 0, then ADBMI42 was coded to -15 (Cannot 
be Computed). Since 2004, adult height and weight will not be top-coded or bottom-coded prior to the construction of ADBMI42. This will result in more values at the high  and low ends for 
ADBMI42.  Starting in 2020, ADBMI42  is top-coded at 50 and bottom-coded at 10. 
Please note: analysts can have access to the height and weight variables and/or can construct a BMI variable of their own through the AHRQ Data Center.
The s
teps used to calculate the BMI for adults >17 are as follows:  
1. Construct adult height and weight variables ADHGTIN and ADWGHT42 based oncollected data
2. Create a preliminary data set containing height, weight, sex, and age data
C-59 MEPS HC -224 


================================================================================
PÁGINA 68
================================================================================

3. Generate a preliminary BMI using the preliminary data set and the procedure for  
calculating the BMI for adults as described on the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention website
4. Create the adult BMI variable ADBMI42 using the preliminary adult BMI, setting all 
respondents that have SAQELIG=0 to - 1 (Inapplicable).  
Health Status  
The SAQ contained three measures of health status: the Veteran RAND (VR -12), a registered 
trademark, the Kessler Index (K6) of non- specific psychological distress, and the Patient Health 
Questionnaire (PHQ-2). More information about the VR- 12 is available through the Boston 
University School of Public Health website . K ey references for these three measures are Kessler 
et al (2002), Kroenke et al (2003), Selim et al (2018) and Selim et al (2009). 
Vet
erans RAND 12 Version (VR -12) 
The Veterans RAND 12 Item Health Survey (VR-12©) is a self -administered health survey 
comprising 12 items used to measure health related quality of life, to estima te d isease burden and 
to evaluate disease-specific impact on general and selected populations.  
The VR instrument uses five-point ordinal response choices for four items in the VR-12©. 
Response choices are five-point response choices: “no, none of the time ”,  “yes, a little of the 
time”, “yes, some of the time”, “yes, most of the time” and “yes, all of the time.” These answers 
then contribute to the scales for role limitations due to physical and emotional problems (PCS) and the physical and mental summary s co
 res (MCS).  
In analyzing data from the VR -12, the standard approach is to form two summary scores based 
on responses to the 12 questions. The standard scoring algorithms for both the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS) incorporate information from all 12 questions. However, the PCS weights more heavily responses to the following questions: ADGENH42, ADDAYA42, ADCLIM42, ADACLS42, ADWKLM42, and ADPAIN42. The MCS weights more heavily responses to the following questions: ADPRST42, ADPCFL42, ADEMLS42, ADMWDF42, and ADSOCA42. The computer programs to create VR scales and PCS/MCS summaries are copyrighted (all rights reserved) by the Trustees of Boston University to ensure the integrity of the assessments. 
The
 comparability of the 2017 MEPS VR-12 PCS and MCS summary scores from the standard 
scoring algorithm and the SF-12v2 PCS and MCS summary scores obtained from prior years of 
MEPS was assessed, and it was determined that the scores were misaligned. A bridging algorithm specif ic to MEPS was developed by a team at the Boston University School of Public 
Health. The goal of this bridging algorithm was to align the VR -12 PCS and MCS scores from 
the 2017 MEPS as closely as possible with the SF-12v2 PCS and MCS scores from prior MEPS years across a wide range of MEPS subpopulations. This bridging algorithm was applied to the VR-12 PCS and MCS score variables (VPCS42 and VMCS42) available on this data file. 
The PCS and MCS cannot be computed directly if a person has missing data for an y of the 
twelve items. A proprietary method was used for imputing the PCS and MCS scores if some data 
 C-60 MEPS HC -224 
 


================================================================================
PÁGINA 69
================================================================================

are missing. The bridging algorithm used for these measures was developed to be tolerant of 
missing data in item responses when computing PCS and MCS scor es. 
Therefore, the variables VPCS42 and VMCS42 include some cases in which the scores have been imputed. Some cases were unable to be scored in the bridging algorithm due to the amount of missing data in item responses; these cases have VRFLAG42 = 0 (No). VRFLAG42 indicates whether the physical component summary, VPCS42, or the mental component, VMCS42, was imputed for a respondent. Persons who were not eligible for the SAQ, or who were eligible but for whom no data existed based on SAQELIG, or who did not have a positive SAQ weight, were set to “Inapplicable” ( -1) for VRFLAG42 , VPCS42 and VMCS42. Any remaining persons who 
could not be scored were set to “Cannot be Computed” (-15) for VPCS42 and VMCS42. Additionally, beginning in 2017, there are no negative score values of VPCS42 and VMCS42 because they are both top - and bottom-coded. 
More information on the VR-12 can be found on the Boston University website VR-12 page

Non- Specific Psychological Distress  
The 2020 SAQ includes six mental health -related questions, using the “K- 6” scale developed by 
R.C. Kessler and colleagues. These questions assess the person’s non- specific psychological 
distress during the past 30 days.  
The non- specific psychological distress variables are as follows:  
ADNERV42 - During the past 30 days, how often felt nervous 
ADHOPE42 - During the past 30 days, how often felt hopeless 
ADREST42 - During the past 30 days, how often felt restless or fidgety  
ADSAD42 - During the past 30 days, how often felt so sad that nothing could cheer the 
person up 
ADEFRT42 - During the past 30 days, how often felt that everything was an effort 
ADWRTH42 - During the past 30 days, how often felt worthless 
Kessler Index (K6)  
A summary of the six variables above provides an index to measure non- specific, rather than 
disorder-specific, psychological distress, using the following values:  
0 None of the Time  
1 A Little of the Time  
2 Some of the Time  
3 Most of the Time  
4 All of the Time  
The index, called K6SUM42, is a summation of the values of the six variables above. The higher the value of K6SUM42, the greater the person’s tendency towards mental disability.  
Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ- 2) 
The 2020 SAQ includes two additional mental health questions. These questions assess the frequency of the person’s depressed mood and decreased interest in usual activities.  
ADINTR42 - During the past two weeks, bothered by having little interest or pleasure in doing things 
ADDPRS42 - During the past two weeks, bothered by feeling down, depressed, or hopeless 
 C-62 MEPS HC -224 
 


================================================================================
PÁGINA 71
================================================================================

PHQ242 is a summation of the values of the two variables above, with scores ran ging from 0 
through 6. The higher the value of PHQ242, the greater the person’s tendency towards 
depression. Kroenke et al. (2003) suggest a score of 3 as the optimal cut point for screening purposes. Note that these items are intended as a screening measure for depression and are not equivalent to a DSM-V diagnosis of depression. 
Mental Health SAQ (MSAQ)  
The 2020 SAQ includes several new measures for mental health treatment. 
ADSLEEP42 - During past 30 days, how often experienced trouble getting to 
sleep or staying asleep  
ADNUMDRK42 - How many drinks containing alcohol on a typical day of drinking 
ADOFTALC42  - During past 12 months, doctor, nurse, or other health care professional asked how much and how often drink alcohol 
ADMNTRT42 - During past 12 months, get counseling, treatment or medicine for any of these reasons  
ADRATETRT42 - Rate counsel ing or  treatment  received in past 12 months 
ADTRTHLP42 - During past 12 months, how much helped by counseling or treatment  
ADTRTPD42 - How much of the counseling or treatment in the past 12 months 
was paid for by another source besides person or their  family

The language in which the SAQ was completed is indicated by the variable ADLANG42. If the English version of the SAQ was completed, ADLANG42 was coded “1” (English Version SAQ Was Administered). If the Spanish version of the SAQ was completed, or if the English version was translated into Spanish, ADLANG42 was coded “2” (Spanish Version SAQ Was Administered). If the language in which the SAQ was administered could not be determined from the data, ADLANG42 was coded “ -15” (Cannot be Computed).  
The month and year the SAQ was completed are indicated by the variables ADCMPM42 and ADCMPY42, respectively. 
When using the SAQ variables in analysis, weights specific to these questions should be used 
(SAQWT20 F). For perso ns who are not assigned a positive SAQ weight, the SAQ variables are 
recoded to “Inapplicable” (-1). Please see Section 3.0 “Survey Sample Information” for details. 
Diabetes Care Survey (DCS)  
The Diabetes Care Survey (DCS), a self -administered paper- and-pencil questionnaire, was 
fielded during Panel 23 Round 7, Panel 2 4 Round 5, and Panel 2 5 Round 3. Households received 
a DCS based on their response to DIABDX_M18 in the Priority Conditions Enumeration (PE) section of the CAPI instrument, which asks whether the person was ever told by a doctor or health professional that he/she had diabetes. Note that only those 18 years or older were asked to complete a DCS questionnaire.  
The DCS asks the same question as DIABDX_M18 with responses summarized in the variable 
DSDIA53. DSDIA53 confirms that the person has ever been told by a health professional that he/she had diabetes or sugar diabetes. Every year, a small number ( 55) of people answer no to 
the diabetes diagnosis question (DCS.DIABDIAG) on the DCS. These people have DSDIA53 initially set to “2” (No). DCS.DIABDIAG is used in the development of the diabetes weight (DIABWyyF); if the person has DCS.DIABDIAG = “2” (No) they do not receive a diabetes weight (DIABWyyF = 0). In the final stage of DCS variable construction, DCS constructed variables, excluding the eligibility variable (DCSELIG) were recoded to “- 1” where DIABWyyF 
= 0. For these cases, DIABDX_M18 =YES (1) but DSDIA53 = NO (2). The DCS data are unedited, and, therefore, these and other data inconsistencies remain in the data. For all persons 17 years of age or younger, all the DCS variables are set to “- 1” (Inapplicable) because there is 
not an appropriate weight included on the file to make national estimates for this population.  
DSA1C53 indicates the number of times the respondent reported having a hemoglobin A1c 
blood test in 2019. Note that, prior to 2005, DSA1C53 did not reflect whether the person had a hemoglobin A1c blood test, only whether the person had a hemoglobin A1c test. DSFT2153, DSFT 2053, D SFT1953, DSFB 1953, and DSFTNV53 indicate whether the respondent reported 
having his or her feet checked for sores or irritations: in 2021, in 2020, in 2019, before 2019, or

never, respectiv
ely. DSEY21 53, DSEY2053, DSEY1953, DSEB1953 and DSEYNV53 indicate 
whether the respondent reported having an eye exam in which the pupils were dilated: in 2021, 
in 2020, in 2019, before 2019, or never, respectively. DSCH2153, DSCH 2053, DSCH1953, 
DSCB 1953, and DSCHNV53 indicate the last time the respondent reported having his or her 
blood cholesterol checked: in 2021, in 2020, in 2019, before 2019, or never, respectively. DSFL 2153, DSFL2053, DSFL 1953, DSVB1953, and DSFLNV53 indicate when the person got 
a flu vaccination including the flu vaccine nas al spray: in 2021, in 2020, in 2019, before 2019, or 
never, respectively. DSKIDN53 and DSEYPR53 ascertain whether the diabetes has caused kidney or eye problems, respectively. DSDIET53, DSMED53, and DSINSU53 indicate if the respondent reported being treate d for his/her diabetes by the following methods: diet, oral 
medications, or insulin, respectively.  
The five variables that assess different ways the person with diabetes can learn about diabetes 
care are: DSCPCP53 (learned care from a primary care provider), DSCNPC53 (learned care from a provider not in the person’s primary care practice), DSCPHN53 (learned care from a phone call with a provider), DSCINT53 (learned care from reading about it on the internet), and DSCGRP53 (learned care by taking a group cl ass). Creation of these variables is based on the 
answer to a gate question, which asks, “During the last 12 months, have you learned how to take care of your diabetes?” Please note that there is no variable listed in the codebook to indicate the answer to  that question, since it is only used for creation of the follow-up variables DSCPCP53, 
DSCNPC53, DSCPHN53, DSCINT53, and DSCGRP53. These follow- up variables are set to 
Inapplicable ( -1) for persons who report not  having learned how to take care of their diabetes 
during the last 12 months. The variable DSCONF53 indicates how confident the person is in treating his or her diabetes. Those variables that indicate a range of care outside the data year may represent persons with additional information included on the 2019 or the 2021 Full Year 
Consolidated PUF. Additional data for the second- year panel may be available on the 2019 PUF.  
If a person was unable to respond to the DCS, the questionnaire was completed by a proxy (DSPRX53 = 1). A special weight variable (DIABW 20F) has been designed to be used with 
DCS data. This weight adjusts for DCS nonresponse and weights to the number of diabetics in the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population in 2020 (see Section 3.0 “Survey Sample Information” for details). W hen using these variables in analysis, weights specific to each of 
these sets of questions should be used (SAQWT20F and  DIABW 20F). For persons who are not 
assigned a positive DCS weight, the DCS variables are recoded to “Inapplicable” ( -1). Please see 
Section 3.0 “Survey Sample Information” for details.  
2.5.7  Disability Days Indicator Variables (DDNWRK 20-OTHNDD 20)  
The Disability Days (DD) section of the core interview contains questions about time lost from work because of a physical illness or injury, or a mental or emotional problem. Data were 
collected on each individual in the household. These questions were repeated in each round of interviews; this file contains data from Rounds 6 and 7 of the MEPS Panel 23, initiated in 2018; Rounds 3, 4, and 5 of t he MEPS Panel 2 4, initiated in 2019; and Rounds 1, 2, and 3 of the MEPS 
Panel 2 5, initiated in 20 20.

================================================================================
PÁGINA 74
================================================================================

Beginning in FY
 2015, annualized versions of these variables are constructed for release rather 
than the previously released versions, which were round- and panel-specific. The number at the 
end of the variable name (20) identifies the variable as representing data from 20 20. Due to 
confidentiality concerns, the annual Disability Days variables, which represent the number of days a person missed work (DDNWRK20 and OTHNDD20), are top -coded to mask values that 
exceed the top one-half of one percent of the population. 
These annual variables use building block variables for construction, which represent an 
individual panel within the data year. The reference per iod for the Disability Days questions is 
the time period between the beginning of the panel or the previous interview date and the current interview date. Analysts should be aware that Round 3 is conducted across years. The Disability Days variables reflect only the data pertinent to the calendar year (i.e., the current delivery year of 2020). Analysts who are interested in examining Disability Days data across years can link to other person-level PUFs using the DUPERSID.  
The flow of the Disability Days se ction relies on the person’s age as of the interview date. 
Therefore, the round-specific constructed age variables (AGE31X, AGE42X, and AGE53X) are 
used to construct the comparable round-specific Disability Days building block variables. Due to the age -specific nature of the Disability Days section, age data from other rounds are not used 
should the person’s age for the round be missing.  
The variable DDNWRK 20 represents the number of times the person lost a half- day or more 
from work because of illness, injury, or mental or emotional problems during the calendar year. 
A response of “no work days lost” was coded zero; if the person did not work, this variable was coded -1 (Inapplicable). The analyst should note that there are cases where EMPST## = 1 or 2 (has current job or job to return to) where DDNWRK20 contains a positive value, indicating the 
number of times the person lost a half-day or more from work. This is because the responses to the Disability Days questions are independent of the responses to the employment questions. Persons who were less than  16 years old or whose age is missing (AGE##X is set to -1) were not 
asked about work days lost, thus this variable is coded -1 (Inapplicable) for these persons. 
A final set of variables indicates if an individual took a half- day or more off from work to c are 
for the health problems of another individual in the family and the number of days missed. 
OTHDYS 20 indicates if a person missed work because of someone else’s illness, injury, or 
health care needs, for example to take care of a sick child or relative.  This variable has three 
possible answers: yes - missed work to care for another (coded 1); no - did not miss work to care for another (coded 2); or the person does not work (coded -1), based on the setting of DDNWRK20. Persons younger than 16 and persons whose age is missing were not asked this question and are also coded as -1 (in a small number of cases this was not done for the 1996 data, the analyst will need to make this edit when doing longitudinal analyses).  
OTHNDD20 indicates the number of days in which work was lost because of another’s health 
problem. Persons younger than 16, those whose age is missing, those who do not work, and those who answer “no” to OTHDYS 20 are skipped out of OTHNDD20 and receive a code of -1.  
Note that , because Disability  Days variables use only those Round 3 data pertinent to the data 
year, it is possible to have a person report missing work to care for the health problems of 
 C-66 MEPS HC -224 
 


================================================================================
PÁGINA 75
================================================================================

another individual (OTHDYS20 = 1) but report no days missed (OTHNDD20 = 0). This 
combination indicates that the person did not miss those workdays during the data year. Editing was done on these variables to preserve the skip patterns. No imputation was done for those with missing data.  
2.5.8  Access to Care Variables (ACCELI42 - CVDLAYPM53 ) 
The variab les ACCELI42 through AFRDPM42 describe data from the Access to Care (AC) 
section of the MEPS HC questionnaire, which was administered in Panel 23 Round 6, Panel 2 4 
Round 4, and Panel 2 5 Round 2. This supplement gathers information on family members’ usual 
source of health care; characteristics of usual source of health care providers; access to and satisfaction with the usual source of health care provider; and affordability of medical treatment, dental treatment, and prescription medicines.  
The variable ACCELI42 indicates whether persons were eligible to receive the Access to Care 
questions. Persons with ACCELI42 set to ‘-1’ (Inapplicable) should be excluded from estimates made with the Access to Care data.  
Beginning in 2020, the variables CVDLAYCA53, CVDLAYDN53, and CVDLAYPM53 describe data from the COVID (CV) section of the MEPS HC questionnaire, which was administered in Panel 23 Round 7, Panel 24 Round 5, and Panel 25 Round 3. This supplement gathers information on whether a person was delayed in getting medical care, dental  treatment , 
and prescription medicine due to the coronavirus pandemic from March 2020 to interview date. 
Family Members’ Usual Source of Health Care  
For each individual family member, the AC section ascertains whether there is a particular doctor’s office, clinic, health center, or other place that the individual usually goes to if he/she is sick or needs advice about his/her health (HAVEUS42).  
PRACTP42 indicates whether a usual source of care (USC) provider has his or her own practice 
that is not part of a group practice, health center, clinic, or other facility. For those family members who have a USC provider, AC30 ascertains the type of practice: 
1  Own Practice, Not Part of Group/Facility  
2  Practice Associated with Group/Facility  
YNOUSC42_M18 indicates the main reason why a person does not have a USC provider. For those family members who do not have a USC provider, question AC40 ascertains the main reason why : 
1  Seldom or Never Sick  
2  Recently Moved to Area  
3  Just Changed Insurance Plans

In 2018, YNOUSC42 was renamed to YNOUSC42_M18 because the list of answer categories 
changed.  
Characteristics of Usual Source of Health Care Providers  
The AC section collects information about the different characteristics of each unique USC provider for a given family. If a person does not have a USC provider (HAVEUS42 is set to ‘2’ (No), ‘- 7’ (Refused), ‘ -8’ (Don’t Know) or ‘-15’ (Cannot be Computed)), then these variables are 
set to ‘ -1’ (In applicable).  
The basis for the AC provider questions is PROVTY42_M18. This variable indicates whether the person’s provider is a facility (‘1’), a person (‘2’), or a person- in-facility (‘3’). 
PROVTY42_M18 is a copy of PROVTYPE_M18 (Provider Type) for pe rsons who have a USC 
provider. Depending on how PROVTYPE_M18 is set, persons are asked about the provider’s location, the provider’s personal characteristics (e.g., race), the provider’s accessibility, and the person’s satisfaction with the provider. In 2018, PROVTY42 was renamed PROVTY42_M18 because of changes to CAPI.  
Provider Location  
Two variables indicate the location of the provider. For facility or person- in-facility type 
providers, PLCTYP42 indicates whether the person’s facility is a Hospital Clinic or Outpatient Department (‘1’), Hospital Emergency Room (‘2’), or Other Kind of Place (‘3’). According to CAPI flow, persons do not report the type of facility for person-type providers; therefore, if PROVTY42_M18 is set to ‘2’ (Person), PLCTYP42 is set to ‘-1’ (Inapplicable).  
For all provider types, including person-type, LOCATN42 indicates whether the person’s 
provider is located in an Office (‘1’), a Hospital but Not the Emergency Room (‘2’), or a Hospital Emergency Room (‘3’).

Personal Characteristics o f Providers  
For person and person- in-facility type providers, TYPEPE42 indicates what type of doctor or 
other medical provider the person’s provider is. The possible values include:

24 Alternative Care Provider  
TYPEPE42 is constructed using variables coll ected at several questions: AC70 “Is provider a 
medical doctor?” (PROV.MEDTYPE_M18); AC80 “Is provider a nurse, nurse practitioner, 
physician’s assistant, midwife, or some other kind of person?” (PROV.OTHTYPE_M18); and AC90 “What is provider’s specialty?” (PROV.MDSPECLT_M18). If  respondents choose ‘91’ 
(Other) at AC80 or AC90, they are asked at AC80OS or AC90OS, respectively, to provide a verbal explanation of the type of provider or medical doctor. These text strings can be recoded to one of the existing categorical values listed above or, if the frequency of the response warrants it, additional categorical values. Recoding is described in greater detail below.  
The AC section also collects demographic information about person and person- in-facility type 
providers (PROVTY42 = 2 or 3). Six variables indicate the provider’s race: WHITPR42 (White), 
BLCKPR42 (Black/African American), ASIANP42 (Asian), NATAMP42 (Indian/Native American/Alaska Native), PACISP42 (Other Pacific Islander) and OTHRCP42 (Other Race). The respondent may choose more than one race for a single provider. These variables reflect the 
answer categories given at AC110.  
In addition to the race variables, two other demographic variables are created: HSPLAP42 indicates whether or not the provider is Hispanic or Latino, and GENDRP42 indicates whether the provider is Male (‘1’) or Female (‘2’).  
Using Constructed Variables to Describe the Usual Source of Care Provider  
These variables describing a person’s USC provider can be used in combination to present a broader picture of the provider. For example, a person- in-facility provider with a particular 
person named who is a white, Hispanic, female pediatrician, with no other race specified, and whose location is in a hospital is coded as: 
PROVTY42_M18 = 3 
PLCTYP42  = 1 
TYPEPE42  = 3 
HSPLAP42  = 1 
WHITPR42  = 1 
BLCKPR42  = 2 ASIANP42  = 2 
NATAMP42  = 2 
PACISP42  = 2 
OTHRCP42  = 2 
GENDRP42  = 2 
LOCATN42  = 2 
Access to and Satisfaction with the Provider  
The AC section collects i nformation regarding the person’s ability to access the USC provider as 
well as the person’s satisfaction with the USC provider.

Access to the Provi
der 
TMTKUS42 indicates how long it takes the person to travel to the USC provider: Less Than 15 
Minutes (‘1’), 15 to 30 Minutes (‘2’), 31 to 60 Minutes (‘3’), 61 to 90 Minutes (‘4’), 91 Minutes to 120 Minutes (‘5’), or More than 120 Minutes (‘6’). 
OFFHOU42, PHNREG42, and AFTHOU42 assess aspects of the provider that may make it 
difficult for the person to get in contact with the USC provider. OFFHOU42 indicates whether the provider has office hours at night or on the weekend. The remaining two variables reflect the person’s rating of the difficulty of accessing the USC provider by phone (PHNREG42), and after hours (AFTHOU42). The person has the following choices: Very Difficult (‘1’), Somewhat Difficult (‘2’), Not Too Difficult (‘3’), or Not at All Difficult (‘4’).  
Satisfaction with the Provider  
These variables reflect the person’s satisfaction with the USC provid er. The person’s level of 
satisfaction with the USC provider is examined in four ways: Does the USC provider: usually ask about prescription medications and treatments other doctors may give them (TREATM42), ask the person to help make decisions between a choice of treatments (DECIDE42), present and explain all options to the person (EXPLOP42), and speak the person’s language or provide translator services (PRVSPK42).  
PRVSPK42 is set to a value other than ‘- 1’ (Inapplicable) for persons eligible for the Access to 
Care supplement, who had a usual source of care, were identified as speaking a language other than English at home ( OTHLGSPK = ‘1’) and speaking English either  “Not Well” or “Not at 
All” (HWELLSPK = ‘3’ or ‘4’). PRVSPK42 is set to ‘- 1’ (Inapplicable) for all persons not 
meeting these criteria or who were deceased, institutionalized, or younger than 5 years of age.  
If the person was under 5 years old in Round 1 and age 5 in Round 2 of the first year panel or 
Round 4 of the second year panel, and the source data are missing, PRVSPK42 was set to ‘- 1’ 
(Inapplicable); if the source data are available, PRVSPK42 was set per specifications.  
Affordability of Medical Care , Dental Care , and Prescription Medicines  
The Access to Care supplement gather s information on whether care was not received or was 
delayed because of cost in the past 12 months. These questions are split into three sections inquiring about medical care, d ental  care, and prescription medicines . Each section inquires 
whether the person did not receive care because they could not afford it (AFRDCA42, 
AFRDDN42, AFRDPM42) . The affordability variables indicate with a value of ‘1’ (Yes) that the 
person needed care but was unable to afford it , a value of ‘2’ (No) that the person did not have any unmet needs for that type of care because of the cost.  
Respondents were also asked if anyone in the household delayed receiving care because of worry about cost (DLAYCA42, DLAYDN42, DLAYPM42). The delay variables indicate with a value of ‘1’ (Yes) that the person was delayed in receiving that type of care because of worry about the cost, and a value of ‘2’ (No) for these variables indicates that the person was not delayed in seeking that type of care because of the worry about the cost.

Editing the Access to Care Variables  
Editing consisted primarily of logical editing for consistency with skip patterns. Other editing 
included the construction of new response values and new variables describing the recoding of “other specify” text items into existing or new categorical values, which are described below.  
Not all variables or categories that appear in the Access to Care section of the HC questionnaire are included on the file,  as some small cell sizes have been suppressed to maintain 
confidentiality.  
Recoding of Additional Other Specify Text Items  
For Access to Care items AC80 and AC90, the “other specify” text responses were reviewed and coded as an existing or new value for the related categorical variable (AC80 and AC90).  
OTHTYPE_M18 and MDSPECLT_M18 are used to construct the variable TYPEPE42. These variables’ text strings can be recoded to each other’s categories. For example, for persons who indicate that their USC provider is not a medical doctor (PROV.MEDTYPE = 2), the other type of USC provider is other (PROV.OTHTYPE = 91), and the text string collected is “GYNECOLOGIST ,” TYPEPE42 would be set to ‘4’ (MD - OB/GYN) instead of ‘11’ (OTHER 
NON- MD PROVIDER.)  
Delayed Medical Care, Dental Care, and Prescription Medicines due to the Coronavirus 
Pandemic  
The COVID section (CV) gathered information on family members’ abilities to receive treatment without delay from March 2020 until the dates of these interviews: Panel 23 Round 7, Panel 24 Round 5, and Panel 25 Round 3. These questions were split into three sections inquiring about medical care, dental care, and prescription medicines. Each section asks whether anyone in the household delayed receiving care because of the coronavirus pandemic. If the respondent answered ‘1’ (Yes), they were asked to identify who in the household delayed care. Within a household that had care delayed, the variables CVDLAYCAS53 (Delay Med Care For COVID R5/3), CVDLAYDN53 (Delay Getting Dental For COVID R5/3), and CVDLAYPM53 (Delay Getting PMED For COVID R5/3) indicate with a value of ‘1’ (Yes) that the person was delayed in receiving that care during the pandemic; a value of ‘2’ (No) for these variables indicates that the person was not delayed in receiving that type of care during the pandemic. 
2.5.9  Employment Variables (EMPST31 -RTPLN53H)  
Employment questions were asked of all persons 16 years and older at the time of the interview. Employment variables consist of person- level indicators such as employment status and 
job-related variables such as hourly wage. All job- specific variables refer to a person’s current 
main job. The current main job, defined by the respondent, indicates the main source of employment.

Historically, most employment var iables pertain to the interview date for Rounds 1-4, and to 
December 31 of the delivery year for Round 5 of a second year panel. In 2020, Panel 23 was 
fielded for a third year with Round 6 and Round 7 interviews, and for the first time, the 2020 employment data include Round 5 variables for a panel in its third year. Employment variables in this file have been constructed so that Panel 23 Round 5 variables in ‘31’ reflect employment in the time period between the Round 4 and the Round 5 interview dates and that Panel 23 variables in ‘42’ reflect employment in the time period between  the Panel 23 Round 5 and 
Panel  23 Round 6 interview dates. (Instead of reflecting employment as it was collected in the 
survey where Round 5 data ended at 12/31/2019 and Round 6 covered 1/1/2020 to Round 6 interview date.)  
Adjustment details are discussed after a description of variable naming protocols because it is helpful to understand variable naming when discussing the impact of data adjustment process on construction of Empl oyment variables.  
It is important to note that starting in 2021, CAPI collected employment status for Panel 25 Round 3, Panel 24 Round 5, and Panel 23 Round 7 as of the interview date in 2021. As a result, adjustments discussed here for third year Panel 23 Round 5 will not be necessary in future data years.

riable naming protocol is consistent with all prior years. Historically round dates have been 
indicated by two numbers following the variable name; the first number representing the round 
for second panel persons (Panel 24), the second number representing the round for first panel persons (Panel 25). For example, EMPST31 refers to employment status on the Round 3 interview date for Panel 24 persons and employment status on the Round 1 interview date for Panel 25 persons. In 2020, a third year panel will be included in each of the ‘31’, ‘42’, and ‘53’ variables, but that round number (5, 6, 7) will not be included in the variable name. For example, the 2020 version of EMPST31 (noted above) will also include employment status on the Round 5 interview date for Panel 23 persons. As a result, the Employment variables reflect the following addition of a third year panel to the data: Panel 23 Round 5 information is contained in the ‘31’ variables, Round 6 is contained in the ‘42’ variables, and Round 7 in contained in the ‘53’ variables. (Some users might find it helpful to think of these variables as (5)31, (6)42, and (7)53, even though the naming convention remains as 31, 42, and 53).  
Panel 23 ‘31’ Employment variables were developed using special processing to incorporate 
2020 employment information reported as of the Round 5 interview date. Information collected in Round 5 and Round 6 were us ed to simulate (a) Round 5 employment over a time frame that 
includes 1/1/20 to the Round 5 interview date (instead of ending Round 5 employment as of 12/31/19) and (b) Round 6 employment over a time frame between the Round 5 and Round 6 interview dates (i nstead of between 1/1/2020 and the Round 6 interview date). Job rosters were 
changed so that a job reported in Round 6 that began or ended between January 1, 2020 and the Round 5 interview date became either a current or former Round 5 job. In addition to using an adjusted job roster, Employment variables in this delivery were constructed using adjusted versions of INSCOP31 and AGE31X that reflect household status and age as of the Round 5 interview date.  
Because of this adjustment, the Round 6 reference period used in constructing Panel 23 ‘42’ variables was shortened to begin at the Round 5 interview date, instead of on January 1, 2020. Like Panel 23 ‘31’ variables, Panel 23 ‘42’ Employment variables were constructed from the adjusted job roster and adjusted versions of INSCOP42 and AGE42X. Adjusted INSCOPrr and AGErrX are not available for public use. 
For these reasons, users should note the following: 
1. Panel 23 Round 5 values in the ‘31’ variables in 2020 data differ from corresponding 
Panel 23 Round 5 values in the ‘53’ variables on the 2019 Population Characteristics File because the 2019 values represent the Round 5 reference period ending 12/31/19, and the 2020 values represent the Round 5 reference period between 1/1/20 and the Round 5 interview date in 2020. For instance, a person may have been 15 as of 12/31/19 and turned 16 between 1/1/20 and the Round 5 interview date. The 2019 Round 5 employment status variable EMPST53 would indicate “Inapplicable”

(-1) and the 2020 Round 5 employment status variable EMPST31 will indicate 
“Employed at RD3/1 Int Date” (1).  
2. Panel 23 Round 5 values in the INSCOP31 and AGE31X variables in this public use file are copies of INSCOP42 and AGE42X, i.e. scope and age as of Round 6 interview date. For 70 persons in this file , INSCOP31 and AGE31X show that the 
person is in scope and 16 years or older. Therefore, we expect ‘31’ Employment variables to have values other than “Inapplicable” (-1). However, because the non-public adjusted values of INSCOP31 and AGE31X used to const ruct Employment 
variables show that the person is out of scope or less than16 years of age, Employment ‘31’ variables are set to “Inapplicable” ( -1). O f the 70 cases,  64 are 
children whose 16
th birthday occurred after the Round 5 interview date, but before 
the Round 6 interview date in 2020. An additional 6 persons were not in the Round 5 household. By copying their Round 6 age value back to the Round 5 age variable, they would be incorrectly identified as in  scope and old enough (16 or older) to be 
asked employment questions in Round 5. Users may wish to edit the values of the AGE31X variable by subtracting 1 year for persons with EMPST = -1 and INSCOP31 = 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. 
A complete description of special processing required to incorporate 2020 calendar year into Panel 23 ‘31’ and ‘42’ variables based on the Round 5 interview date may be found in Appendix 4. 
With the exception of some health insurance and wage variables, no attempt has been made to 
logically edit any employment variables. When missing, va lues were imputed for certain 
persons’ hourly wages. Due to confidentiality concerns, hourly wages greater than or equal to $103.36 were top -coded to -10 and the number of employees variable was top-coded at 500. 
With the exception of a variable indicating  whether the employer has more than one location 
(MORE31, MORE42, MORE53), all employer- specific variables refer to the specific 
establishment that is the location of a person’s current main job.  
For users interested in additional jobs (i.e. current miscellaneous, former main job, and others) or 
additional details about the current main job, please refer to the Jobs Public Use release file for the current delivery year.  
The MEPS employment section used dependent interviewing in Rounds 2 through 7. If emplo yment status and certain job characteristics did not change from the previous round, as 
identified in the Review of Employment (RJ) section, the respondent was skipped through the main employment section. A code of “Determined in Previous Round” (- 2) is us ed to indicate 
that the information in question was obtained in a previous round. For example, if HRWG42X (Round 6 interview date hourly wage for Panel 23 persons, or Round 4 interview date hourly wage for Panel 2 4 persons, or Round 2 interview date hourly wage for Panel 2 5 persons) is 
coded as “Determined in Previous Round” (-2) , it means that hourly wage was collected in a 
previous round. In this case, users would need to refer to HRWG31X (Round 5 interview date hourly wage for Panel 23 persons, Round 3 interview date hourly wage for Panel 24 persons, or Round 1 interview date hourly wage for Panel 2 5 persons) to obtain the value for HRWG42X. 
The “-2” value for HRWG42X indicates that the person was skipped past the hourly wage 
 C-75 MEPS HC -224 
 


================================================================================
PÁGINA 84
================================================================================

question at the time of the R ound 6/4/2 interview. The same coding applies to HRWG53X when 
a person was skipped past the Round 7/5/3 interview. Note that users may find a positive value in 
the HRWG31X (Round 5/3/1 hourly wage) or they may find an “Inapplicable” code of -1. Unlike HRWG42X and HRWG53X, HRWG31X does not contain -2 values. For persons skipped in Round 5/3/1, the prior year hourly wage value is used to populate HRWG31X. The prior year round in which the wage was collected for such cases can be found in the RNDGLG31 variable. These cases will be discussed in more detail below.  
To determine who should be skipped through various employment questions, certain information, such as employment status, had to be asked in every round. Note that “-2” codes do not apply to questions asked in every round, like employment status. Additionally, information on whether the person currently worked at more than one job (MORJOB) or whether the person held health insurance from a current main employer (HELD X) was asked in every round, and, 
therefore, those variables also have no “- 2” codes.  
For (a ) Panel 23 persons who have a current main job in Round 5 that continued from Round 1 
or 2 of 2018, (b) Panel 23 persons who have a current main job in Round 5 that continued from Round 3 or 4 of 2019, and (c) Panel 2 4 persons who have a current main job in Round 3 that 
continued from Round 1 or 2 of 2019, the “-2” code is not used. This is because prior year employment variables do not reside on the current 2020 Full Year Release file, and are therefore 
not easily accessible for users (and in some cases, t he data could be impossible to obtain). 
Specifically, Panel 23 Round 1 and 2 employment variables reside on the 2018 Full Year  release 
file and the Panel 23 Round 3 and 4 and the Panel 24 Round 1 and 2 employment variables reside on the 2019 Full Year  release file. For such persons, the values for the variables resulting 
from skipped questions are copied from the appropriate prior year file (2018 or 2019) to the 2020 Full Year Public Use Release ‘31’ variable, depending on the round in which the job first became the current main job :  
• the Panel 23 Round 1 or 2 constructed variable from the 2018 Population Characteristics Public Use release file, or  
• the Panel 23 Round 3 or 4 constructed variable from the 2019 Population Characteristics Public Use release file, or  
• the Panel 24 Round 1 or 2 constructed variable from the 2019 Population Characteristics Public Use release file. 
The accompanying 2020 variable RNDFLG31 indicates the round from which these data were 
collected. For example, if the Panel 24 person has a Round 3 current main job that continues from Round 2 and was first reported as the current main job in Round 2, HRWG31X in the 2020 Full Year Public Use r elease will be a copy of the HRWG42X variable from the 2019 Full Year 
Public Use r elease, and RNDFLG31 in the 2020 Full Year Public Use r elease will be “2”, 
indicating the round in which the job was first reported as the current main job.

Employment Status (EMPST31, EMPST42, and EMPST53)  
Employment status was asked for all persons age 16 or older. Allowable responses to the 
employment status questions were as follows:  
• “currently employed” if the person had a job at the interview date;
• “has a job to return to” if the person did not work during the reference period but hada job to return to as of the interview date;
• “employed during the reference period” if the person had no job at the interview datebut did work during the round;
• “not employed with no job to return to” if the person did not have a job at theinterview date, did not work during the reference period, and did not have a job towhich he or she could return.
These responses were mutually exclusive. A current main job was defined for persons who either reported that they were currently employed and identified a current main job or who reported and identified a job to return to. Therefore, job-specific information such as hourly wage exists for persons not presently working at the interview date but who have a job to return to as of the interview date.  
The analyst should note that there are cases where EMPST rr = 1 or 2 (has current job or job to 
return to) where DDNWRK20 contains a positive value, indicating the number of times the person lost a half-day or more from work. This is because the responses to the Disability Days questions in the survey are independent of the responses to the employment questions. 
Data Collection Round for Round 5, 3 , or 1 CMJ (RNDFLG31)  
As mentioned above, for (a) a Panel 24 person with a  Round 3 current main job (CMJ) that is a 
continuation CMJ from Round 1 or Ro und 2, or (b) a Panel 23 person with a Round 5 CMJ that 
is a continuation CMJ from Round 1, 2, 3, or 4, the value for most ‘31’ variables w ill be copied 
forward from the 20 18 or 2019 Full Year  Public Use r elease from the variable representing the 
round in which the job was first reported as the CMJ. For persons in Panel 23 or Panel 24, RNDFLG31 indicates the 2018 or 2019 round in which the Ro und 5 or Round 3 CMJ was first 
reported as the CMJ and provides a timeframe for the reported wage information and other job details. RNDFLG31 is used with many ‘31’ variables to indicate the round on which the reported information is based.  
RNDFLG31 is set to “Inapplicable” ( -1) for persons in either panel who are under age 16 or who 
do not have a CMJ in Panel 23 Round 5, Panel 2 4 Round 3, or Panel 25 Round 1. For persons 
who are part of Panel 23, RNDFLG31 is also set to “Inapplicable” (- 1) if the person is out-of-
scope in the 2020 portion of Round 5. For persons who are part of Pane l 24, RNDFLG31 is also 
set to “Inapplicable” ( -1) if the person is out-of-scope in the 2020 portion of Round 3. For

-15 Panel 23 Round 5 CMJ/Panel 24 Round 3 CMJ is a continuation CMJ (wage information and other details were not collected in Round 5/Round 3) but the Round 4/Round 2 CMJ record either does not exist or is not the same job. This setting applies even in cases where there is a corresponding Round 1, 2, or 3 CMJ for Panel 23 or Round 1 CMJ for Panel 24. This can occur in rare instances because corrections made to a person’s record in a current file cannot be made to that record in an earlier file due to database processing constraints. Corrections are made based on respondent comments in subsequent rounds that affect employment information previously reported. Users may refer to the 2018 Jobs file to review the Panel 23 Round 1 through Round 3 rosters or to the 2019 Jobs file to review the Panel 23  Round 3 through Round 5/Panel 24 Round 1 through 
Round 3 rosters for these persons. 
Self-Employed (SELFCM31, SELFCM42, and SELFCM53)  
Infor mation on whether an individual was self-employed at the current main job was obtained for 
all persons who reported a current main job. If an individual reports that they are self- employed 
at their current main job, they are also asked to identify whether the self -employed business was 
incorporated, a proprietorship, or a partnership (BSNTY31, BSNTY42, BSNTY53). These questions are not asked of individuals who were not self-employed and, as a result, individuals who are not self- employed are coded with “Inapplicable” ( -1).  
Alternatively, there are several variables that are only constructed for wage earners (not self -
employed). These include benefits, employment characteristics, and hourly wage variables (covered in the following two sections). As noted below, self-employed individuals are coded with “Inapplicable” ( -1) for benefits, employment characteristics, and hourly wage variables.

Benefits and Employment Characteristics (PAYDR31/42/53, SICPAY31/42/53, 
PAYVAC31/42/53, RETPLN31/42/53, MORE31/42/53, JOBORG31/42/53)  
Several variables are constructed only for individuals who report not being self- employed at their 
current main job. These individuals are asked questions to indicate whether the establishment 
reported as the main source of employment offered a ny of the following benefits: 
• Paid leave to visit a doctor (PAYDR31, PAYDR42, and PAYDR53) 
• Paid sick leave (SICPAY31, SICPAY42, and SICPAY53) 
• Paid vacation (PAYVAC31, PAYVAC42, and PAYVAC53) 
• Pension plan (RETPLN31, RETPLN42, and RETPLN53) 
They are also asked information on whether the firm had more than one business location (MORE31, MORE42, MORE53) and whether the establishment was a private for- profit, 
nonprofit, or a government entity (JOBORG31, JOBORG42, JOBORG53). For persons who were self -employed at their current main job, all of the variables detailed in this section were 
coded as “Inapplicable” ( -1).  
Hourly Wage (HRWG31X, HRWG42X, HRWG53X), Wage Update Variable (DIFFWG31, 
DIFFWG42, DIFFWG53), and Updated Hourly Wage (NHRWG31, NHRWG42, 
NHRWG53)  
Hourly wage was constructed for all persons who reported a current main job that was not self-employment (SELFCM). HRWG31X, HRWG42X, and HRWG53X provide the wage 
amount reported initially for a person’s current main job. If a current main job continues into subsequent rounds DIFFWG31, DIFFWG42, and DIFFWG53 indicate if the  wage has changed 
since the previous round. If the job continues and there is a different wage at that job, NHRWG31, NHRWG42, and NHRWG53 indicate the new wage amount. The initial hourly wage variables (HRWG31X, HRWG42X, HRWG53X) on this file should be considered along with their accompanying variables - HRHOW31, HRHOW42, and HRHOW53 - which indicate how the respective round hourly wage was constructed. 
Hourly wage could be derived, as applicable, from a large number of source variables. In the 
simplest case, hourly wage was reported directly by the respondent. For other persons, construction of the hourly wage was based upon salary, the time period on which the salary was based , and the number of hours worked per time period. If the number of hours worked per time 
period was not available, a value of 40 hours per week was assumed, as identified in the HRHOW variable.  
To assist interviewers during collection of wage amounts, CAPI prompts the respondent to confirm wages reported in the Employment Wage section if a wage amount falls outside a specified wage range. Ranges vary depending on the unit of pay as follows: 
 C-79 MEPS HC -224 
 


================================================================================
PÁGINA 88
================================================================================

Unit of Pay Wage Range
 
Per year  $5,000.00 - $200,000.00 
Per month $375.00 - $20,000.00 
Per 2 -week period $150.00 - $10,000.00 
Per week  $75.00 - $5,000.00 
Per day  $10.00 - $750.00 
Per hour $1.00 - $125.00 
Where there 
was insufficient information available for calculating the initial hourly wage, the 
initial ho urly wage variables HRWG31X, HRWG42X, and HRWG53X were imputed using a 
weighted sequential hot-deck procedure for individuals who reported a current main job (and 
were not self -employed ) but did not know their wage or refused to report a wage. Hourly wage 
for persons for whom employment status was not known was coded as “Cannot be Computed” (-15). Additionally, wages were imputed for wage earners who reported a wage range instead of a specific wage value. For each of these persons, a value was imputed from other persons on the file who did report a specific value that fell within the reported r ange. Wages from 2018, 2019, 
and 2020 were eligible donors in this process, expanding the donor pool to cover three years instead of the typical two years. The expansion of the donor pool to use three years of donors instead of two allowed AHRQ to maintain  a similar sized donor pool to prior releases - but it 
does mean that some recipients are assigned a donor wage from three years prior.  
The variables HRWGIM31, HRWGIM42, and HRWGIM53 identify persons whose wages were imputed. Note that wages were imputed only for persons with a positive person and/or positive family weight.  
The variables DIFFWG31, DIFFWG42, and DIFFWG53 indicate whether a person’s wage amount was different in the current round (from the previous round) at a continuing, current main job. NHRWG31, NHRWG42, and NHRWG53 contain the updated wage amount in cases where a person indicates a change in wages (DIFFWG = 1). While the question regarding wage 
changes pertains to the primary wage at the main job, occasionally respondents update a person’s supplemental wage at the main job. In these cases, users should note that the HRWG31X, HRWG42X, HRWG53X variable may contain the same value as the NHRWG31, NHRWG42, NHRWG53 variable. 
For all Panel 25 Round 1 persons, DIFFWG31 and NHRWG31 are set to “Inapplicable” ( -1) 
because this was the first round that wages could be reported for those persons. In Rounds 2 
through 7, no imputation was performed on NHRWG31, NHRWG42, and NHRWG53. Instead, where an updated wage amount is “Don’t Know” (- 8) or is “ Refused” ( -7), NHRWG31, 
NHRWG42, and/or NHRWG53 is set to “Cannot be Computed” (-15). For persons whose hourly wage variable HRWG31X, HRWG42X, and/or HRWG53X was imputed and the respondent provides an updated wage amount in a subsequent round, the new wage, NHRWG31, NHRWG42, and/or NHRWG53, is not presented. Instead, NHRWG31, NHRWG42, and/or NHRWG53 is set to “Initial Wage Imputed” ( -13) to indicate that the initial HRWG31X, 
HRWG42X, and/or HRWG53X was imputed. Users are able to access the value reported for updated wage for these jobs by refer ring to the 2020 Jobs Public Use release fi le .

In most years, wage information is  logically edited for consistency  using established rules and 
guidance from AHRQ . However, in 2020 the typical w age outlier editing process was not 
performed. In typical years, outliers are checked for persons who report a wage change and the 
new reported wage (a) is substantially different from prior wage (change >=100%), (b) is no different than prior wage, (c) is low in value ($0 < wage < $1) or, (d) has a value higher than prior year’s top code value. There are numerous sources for these types of errors, including keystroke or respondent error. In a typical year, approximately 100 wages are reviewed per panel, resulting in approximately 50 wage edits (overall). Users should keep in mind that such edits were not performed in 2020 when using the wage variables, especially when comparing 2020 to other data years. To help users identify cases that would have been reviewed (but not necessarily edited) in this process, the 2020 data includes wage outlier flag variables, OUTFLAGrr. T hese round- specific wage outlier flag variables OUTFLAG31, OUTFLAG42, 
and OUTFLAG53 indicate that a person’s updated wage at the current main job would have been programmatically selected for review during the 2020 wage outlier editing process (but not necessarily edited). The flag is constructed prior to wage imputation, consistent with the timing of full year wage outlier review. A wage is selected for review if one (and only one) of the 
following is true:  
1. A wage is greater than 0 and less than 1  (Low)  
2. A wage where the absolute change between any other  wage is more than 100% (i.e., 
wage more than doubled) (Subst Diff). 
3. An “updated” wage shows no difference in the calculated wage amount (No wage change).  
4. A wage is greater than the previous year wage top code value (High) . 
Sometimes, a person’s wages can meet several conditions. In some cases, OUTFLAG31, OUTFLAG42, and OUTFLAG53 will be set to a value that represents a combination, for example, values 5 or 6: 
5. A wage meets the conditions for both (a) greater than 0 and less than 1 (category 1, Low) and (b) absolute change in wage is more than 100% (category 2, Subst Diff). 
6. A wage meets conditions for both (a) greater than previous year wage top code (category 4, High) and (b) absolute change in wage is more than 100% (category 2, Subst Diff).  
In other cases those cases are given a default value based on whether they are a high wage or low wage. Specifically, in rare circumstances, a person may have a mix of “updated” wage with no difference in calculated wage amount (category 3 - no wage change) with either o f the following 
 C-81 MEPS HC -224

================================================================================

categories: low wage (category 1 - low) or high wage (category 4 - high). OUTFLAG is set to 
either “Low wage outlier” (1) or “High wage outlier (4) respectively for these cases.  
Value  Description  
-1 Inapplicable 
1 Low wage outlier 
2 Substantial difference 
3 No wage change outlier 
4 High wage outlier 
5 Subst diff and low outlier 
6 Subst diff and high outlier 
Us
ers should also keep in mind that many of the high wage outlier amounts identified in 
OUTFLAG have wages that are subsequently top coded as described below. 
For reasons of confidentiality, the hourly wage variables were top-coded. A value of -10 
indicates that the hourly wage was greater than or equal to $ 103.36. The wage top -code process 
uses the highest calculated wage for an individual regardless of whether it was reported in the HRWG31X, HRWG42X, and HRWG53X or NHRWG31, NHRWG42, and NHRWG53 variable. All wages for a person were top- coded if any wage variable was at or above the 
top-code amou nt. 
In order to protect the confidentiality of persons across deliveries, the same top-code amount used in this 2020 Full -Year Consolidated file was also applied to the 2020 Jobs file. Because a 
person can have other jobs besides a current main job which a re included in the corresponding 
2020 Jobs file, wages at these other jobs were reviewed in the top -coding process. In some cases 
for these persons, wages reported at the current main job were below the top-code amount while the wage at another job had to be top-coded. To further protect the confidentiality of such persons across deliveries, wages reported at all jobs in the 2020 Jobs file were top -coded and the 
wages at their current main job (HRWG31X, HRWG42X, HRWG53X,NHRWG31, NHRWG42, and NHRWG53) included in this 2020 Full -Year Consolidated file were also top -coded.

There are several employment -related health insurance measures included in this release: health 
insurance held at a current main job (HELD31X, HELD42X, HELD53X), health insurance offered through a current main job (OFFER31X, OFFER42X, OFFER53X), health insurance offered to anyone through the employer (OFREMP31, OFREMP42, OFREMP53), and choice of health plans available through the current main job (CHOIC31, CHOIC42, CHOIC53).

collection of variables reflects the insurance status in the current round. The variables are 
logically ed ited for consistency for each round.  
MEPS asks if the person holds health insurance through the current main job (HELDX) in the first round in which a person is reported as having that job. If the person does not hold health insurance at the job, then a follow -up question is asked as to whether the person was offered 
insurance but declined coverage (OFFERX ). If the person neither holds nor was offered health 
insurance at the job, then an additional question is asked to determine whether any other employees at the current main job were offered health insurance (OFREMP). If the person either holds or was offered insurance at the job, then an additional question is asked to determine whether a choice of health plans is available at the job (CHOIC).  
In the rounds after the job is first reported, the Review of Jobs (RJ) section has the same series of questions with one exception, it does not ask whether there is a choice of health insurance plans at an employer. Choice of health insurance plan is only asked in the round the job was first reported (in the Employment section). 
In rounds after the job is first reported, a “held” question (whether a person now holds health 
insurance through the employer) is asked in the Review of Jobs section. This is to determine if there has been any change in coverage.  
RJ70 (HELDX) is  asked if insurance was offered, but not taken by the employee, when the job 
was first reported and no coverage has been reported since the initial round.  
RJ80 (HELDX ) is asked where:
 
• insurance coverag e through the job ended in a prior round or 
• insurance coverage through the job was never reported and the person was not 
offered insurance through the job in the round the job was first reported or 
• the respondent disavows insurance coverage in the Health I nsurance section despite 
having previously indicated insurance coverage through the job in the Employment 
section of the interview. 
MEPS then includes several clarifying questions regarding health insurance status and availability to the jobholder through an employer. Where the person does not report, does not know, or refuses to indicate the insurance status at RJ70, or reports no coverage at RJ80, the respondent is asked if the person was offered insurance (OFFERX) . 
Lastly, when a respondent indicates that the jobholder of a reviewed job neither holds nor was offered health insurance at the job, the respondent is asked if any other  employees at the job 
were offered health insurance (OFREMP).  
If a person does hold insurance through their job, then that person is not asked the offer question and the OFFERX variable is automatically set to “Yes” (1). Data users should note that OFREMP is  automatically set to 1 in cases where the jobholder has health insurance coverage 
through the job (HELDX =1) or in cases where health insurance is offered to the employee at

their job (OFFERX =1
). Beginning in 2020, however, OFFERX will no longer be automat ically 
set to Refused” ( -7) and “Don’t Know” (- 8) in cases where the jobholder indicates Refused” ( -7) 
and “Don’t Know” (-8) whether health insurance is held through a newly reported or reviewed 
current main job (HELDX = - 7 OR -8). Instead, OFFERX will be coded “Cannot Be Computed” 
(-15). 
This change makes OFFERX settings consistent with CAPI flow. “Refused” (-7) and “Don’t 
Know” ( -8) responses to EM660 and RJ90 questions, which are used to set HELDX, skip the 
‘offer’ series of questions (EM670, EM690, RJ90, RJ100) in CAPI. 
Similarly, beginning in Full Year 2020, OFREMP will no longer be automatically set to 
Refused” ( -7) and “Don’t Know” (-8) in cases where the respondent indicates insurance was not 
offered to the job holder and either refuses to indicate or does not know whether health insurance was offered to any employee at the current main job (OFFERX = - 7 OR -8). Instead, OFREMP 
will be coded “Cannot Be Computed” (-15). 
This change makes OFREMP settings consistent with CAPI flow. “Refused” (-7) and “Don ’t 
Know” ( -8) responses to EM670 and RJ90 questions, which are used to set OFFERX, skip the 
question regarding whether health insurance is offered to any employee at the current main job 
where the job holder was not offered coverage through the job (EM690, RJ100) in CAPI.  
These changes to OFFERX and OFREMP allows users to impute their own settings. Users should note that these changes resulted in an increase in “Cannot Be Computed” (-15) and 
a corresponding decrease in “Refused” ( -7) and “Don’t Know” (- 8) in both OFFERX and 
OFREMP in all rounds.

For persons who responde
d in the Employment section or Review of Jobs section that they held 
health insurance coverage through the employer and then disavowed the coverage in the Health 
Insurance section, MEPS includes follow-up questions regarding whether health insurance is offered (either to the employee or any other employee depending on responses to questions) and whether more than one plan is available. This information is used in an  edit process whereby 
responses to these questions in the Health Insurance section are transferred into the Employment section or Review of Jobs section. Consequently, more information is available on OFFERX, OFREMP, and CHOIC. Consistent with prior years, the round- specific flag variable DISVW X 
continues to be constructed and reflects the disavowal at the current main job in the round.

For Panel 23 pe
rsons who underwent adjustment of Round 5 and/or Round 6 jobs variables, 
employment- related health insurance variables reflect insurance status as of the adjusted en d 
reference period date. Refer to Appendix 4 for more details.  
Hours (HOUR31, HOUR42, HOUR53)  
The hours variables refer to usual hours worked per week at the current main job. Note that, in 
cases where the respondent estimated hours worked per week at 35 hours or more, HOUR31, 
HOUR42, and HOUR53 were set to ‘40.’ 
Temporary (TEMPJB31, TEMPJB42, TEMPJB53) and Seasonal (SSNLJB31, SSNLJB42, 
SSNLJB53) Jobs  
The temporary job variables (TEMPJB31, TEMPJB42, TEMPJB53) indicate whether a newly reported  current main j ob lasts for only a limited amount of time or until the completion of a 
project.  
The seasonal job variables (SSNLJB31, SSNLJB42, SSNLJB53) indicate whether the newly reported  current main job is only available during certain times of the year. SSNLJB is “Y es” (1) 
if the job is only available during certain times of the year; SSNLJB is “No” (2) if the job is year round. Teachers and other school personnel who work only during the school year are considered to work year round.  
Both variables are set on current main jobs whether a person is self-employed or not. These 
questions are asked only in the round the job is newly reported. Consequently, in rounds following the initial report, a code of “Determined In Previous Round” (-2), is used to indicate that the information in the question was obtained in a previous round. This differs from some 
previous files where both questions were asked in each round and -2 was not an allowed value. Analysts using either of these variables over multiple years of MEPS should refer to documentation for each year to assure consistency for the variable. 
Number of Employees (NUMEMP31, NUMEMP42, NUMEMP53)  
NUMEMP indicates the number of employees at the location of the person’s current main job. Due to confidentiality concerns, this variable has been top-coded at 500 or more employees. For respondents who do not know the specific number of employees at the establishment, a categorical question is offered as an alternative. In these cases, a numerical value for NUMEMP is constructed using a median estimated size calculated from donors within the reported categorical range. As always, median values may vary across panels/rounds since calculations are panel/round specific. One noticeable difference in 2020, however, was on medians ca lculated 
in the highest estimated range (101-500 employees). Where Panel 25 had median establishment size of 200, Panel 23 had a median establishment size of 250, and Panel 24 had a median establishment size of 300. Otherwise, differences were generally less pronounced. 
 C-85 MEPS HC -224 
 


================================================================================
PÁGINA 94
================================================================================

CAPI does not acce
pt an establishment size value of 0 to indicate the total number of employees 
working at a self -employed business . Where a person is not self -employed  at a job, an 
establishment size of 0 is  allowed . NUMEMP is set to “Cannot be Computed” (- 15) for these 
cases.  
Other Employment Variables  
Information about industry and occupation types for a person’s current main job at the interview 
date is also contained in this release. Based on verbatim text fields collected during the interview, numeric industry and occupation codes are assigned by trained coders at the Census Bureau. The coders used 2007 Census Industry and 2010 Census Occupation Coding schemes, which were developed for the Bureau’s Current Population Survey and American Community Survey. Users should note that coding schemes are comparable for the FY 2010 through FY 2020 data files. Earlier versions of Census coding schemes were used on files prior to FY 2010. 
Current main jobs were initially coded at the 4- digit level fo r both industry and occupation. 
Then, for confidentiality reasons, these codes were condensed into broader groups for release on 
the file. INDCAT31, INDCAT42, and INDCAT53 represent the condensed industry codes for a person’s current main job at the interview date. OCCCAT31, OCCCAT42, and OCCCAT53 represent the condensed occupation codes for a person’s current main job at the interview date.  
This release incorporates crosswalks  showing how the detailed 2007 Census industry codes 
(Appendix 1) and 2010 Census occupation codes (Appendix 2) were collapsed into the 
condensed codes on the file. The schemes used in this file can be linked directly to the 2007 North American Industry Code System (NAICS) and the 2010 Standard Occupation Code scheme (SOC) by going to  the U.S. Census Bureau website
 where a variety of
 additional 
crosswalks is also available.  
Information indic
ating whether a person belonged to a labor union (UNION31, UNION42, and 
UNION53) is als
o contained in this release.  
The month and year that the current main job started for Rounds 5, 6, and 7 of Panel 23; Rounds 3, 4, and 5 of Panel 24; and Rounds 1, 2, and 3 of Panel 25  are provided in this release 
(STJBMM31 , STJBYY31, STJBMM42, STJBYY42, STJBMM53, and STJBYY53). In Full 
Year 2020, STJBYY31, STJBYY42, and STJBYY53 are bottom coded to a value of ‘1950’ to preserve age confidentiality. This  value is calculated by taking the delivery year of 2020 and 
subtracting the age top code value of 85, then adding back 15, the age of a person in the year before entering the work force as defined in MEPS. Thus, the bottom code value will be different in each delivery year.  For Panel 23 Round 5 jobs that were first reported in Round 4 or Round 5 
and Panel 24  Round 3 jobs that were first reported in Round 1 or Round 2, the bottom code 
continues to be set to the value calculated in the Full Year 2019 delivery year, 1949. For Panel 23 Round 5 jobs that were first reported in Round 1 or Round 2, the bottom code continues to be set to the value calculated in the Full Year 2018 delivery year, 1948. 
There are two measures included in this release that relate to a person’s work history over a 
lifetime. One indicates whether a person ever retired from a job as of the Round 7 interview date for Panel 23 persons, as of the Round 5 interview date for Panel 24 persons, or as of the Round 3 
 C-86 MEPS HC -224 
 


================================================================================
PÁGINA 95
================================================================================

interview date for Panel 2 5 per sons (EVRETIRE). The other indicates whether a person ever 
worked for pay as of the Round 7 interview date for Panel 23 persons, as of the Round 5 
interview date for Panel 2 4 persons, or as of the Round 3 interview date for Panel 25 persons 
(EVRWRK). The l atter was asked of everyone who indicated that they were not working as of 
the round interview date. Therefore, anyone who indicated current employment or who had a job during any of the previous or current rounds was skipped past the question identifying whether the person ever worked for pay. These individuals were coded as “Inapplicable” (-1). All persons who ever reported a job and were 55 years or older as of the round interview date were asked if they “ever retired”. Since both of these variables are not round specific, there are no “Determined in Previous Round” (- 2) codes.  
This release contains variables indicating the main reason a person did not work since the start of the reference period (NWK31, NWK42, and NWK53). If a person was not employed at all during the reference period (at the interview date or at any time during the reference period) but was employed some time prior to the reference period, the person was asked to choose from a list the main reason he or she did not work during the reference period. NWK31 for Panel 23 persons reflects employment status as of the Round 5 interview date. For the 2020 file, Panel 23 Round 5 data are used to construct NWK31. The values of NWK31 are from the Round 5 interview or the round the person first joined the study. For persons in Panel 23 who were employed between January 1st and the Round 5 interview, but not between the Round 5 and Round 6 interviews, NWK42 is set to either -1 or -15, depending on responses from the round the person first joined the st udy. 
The “Inapplicable” ( -1) category for the NWK variables includes: 
• Persons who were employed during the reference period; 
• Persons who were not employed during the reference period and who were never employed;  
• Persons who were out-of- scope the entire reference period and; 
• Persons who were less than 16 years old. 
A measure of whether an individual had more than one job on the round interview date (MORJOB31, MORJOB42, and MORJOB53) is provided on this release. In addition to those under 16 and those individuals who were out-of-scope, the “Inapplicable” (- 1) category includes 
those who did not report having a current main job. Because this is not a job- specific variable, 
there are no “Determined in Previous Rounds” (-2) codes. 
This release contains variabl es indicating if a current main job changed between the fifth and 
sixth rounds for Panel 23 persons, between the third and fourth rounds for Panel 2 4 persons, or 
between the first and second rounds for Panel 2 5 persons (CHGJ3142) . It also contains a variable 
indicating if a current main job changed between the sixth and seventh rounds for Panel 23 
persons, between the fourth and fifth rounds for Panel 2 4 persons, or between the second and 
third rounds for Panel 2 5 persons (CHGJ4253). In addition to the “Ina pplicable” ( -1), “Refused”

(-7), “Don’t Know” (-8), and “Cannot be Computed” (-15) categories, the change job variables 
were coded to represent the following: 
1  person left previous round current main job and now has a new current main job;  
2 person still working at the previous round’s current main job but, as of the new round, no longer considers this job to be the current main job and defines a new current main job (previous round’s current main job is now a current miscellaneous job);  
3  person left previous round’s current main job and does not have a new job;  
4  person did not change current main job. 
Finally, this release contains the reason given by the respondent for the job change (YCHJ3142 and YCHJ4253). The reasons for a job change were listed in the CAPI questionnaire and a respondent was asked to choose the main reason from this list. In addition to those out-of- scope, 
those under 16, and those not having a current main job, the “Inapplicable” (- 1) category for 
YCHJ3142 and YCHJ4253 includes workers who did not change jobs. 
Employment Variables Imputed for Missing Values (EMPST31H - RTPLN53H)  
To further assist analysts,  a series of fully -imputed employment variables is available on the Full 
Year Consolidated Data File (FY PUF). For the years 2000 to 2013 these variables can be found on MEPS HC-131 (MEPS Employment Variables 2000-2013). For the years 2014 and beyond, these variables can be found in the FY PUF for each data year. The fully -imputed variables in 
this file are developed from the constructed Employment variables in the 2020 FY PUF .  
Observations for these employment variables with values of “Refused” (-7), “Don’t Know” (-8 ), 
or “Cannot be Computed” (-15) were imputed using weighted sequential hot-decking. The imputations were performed separately for each MEPS HC panel across the seven  survey rounds 
of the MEPS. First, all missing values of a given variable were imputed for Round 1. If a person remained in the same job in Round 2, and the MEPS questionnaire did not ask for updated job information (i.e., if the variable on the FY PUF was coded as -2), then the value for that variable was pu lled forward from Round 1 to Round 2 (including values that had been imputed in 
Round 1). After pulling values forward from Round 1, any remaining missing values were imputed for Round 2. This process was repeated for Rounds 3-5. For Panel 2 5, the imputed 
employment variables use constructed employment variables from Round 1, 2 and 3 data on this file. For Panel 2 4, Rounds 3, 4, and 5 data from the current file are used as well as data from 
Rounds 1 and 2 from the 2019 Full -Year PUF. Users who want to combine data on all five 
rounds for an individual in Panel 2 4 should use 2019 data for Rounds 1 and 2 from 
MEPS  HC-216, and 2020 data for Rounds 3, 4 and 5 from the cur rent file. (Note that 
MEPS  HC-216 also has Round 3 information for Panel 24 , but the 2020 PUF  has the most 
up-to-date version of Round 3 information and is the most consistent with 2020 Round 4 and 5 
variables.)  Users may also need 2018 MEPS HC-209 to obtain data for Panel 23 Rounds 1 and 2. 
MEPS HC -216 contains the most current Round 3 information and the 2020 PUF has the most 
current Round 5 information.

Following imputat
ion, no values of -2, -7, -8, or -15 remain on any variable. Due to skip patterns, 
the majority of -1s (question was not asked due to skip pattern) remain. For reasons of 
confide ntiality, values of -10 (hourly wage was top- coded at $ 103.36 ) also remain and employer 
size (number of employees in establishment) is top -coded at 500. 
Variable Naming 
The names of the imputed variables are similar to the names of the corresponding constr ucted 
variables in this file. An ‘H’ suffix is added and the resulting name is shortened to 8 characters 
when necessary (e.g., the imputed version of SELFCM31 is SLFCM31H). The variables CMJHLD31/42/53 differ from this naming convention because they are no t imputed (they 
contain no missing values) but were constructed using information from the Person Round Plan (PRPL) File (MEPS HC -223). CMJHLD31/42/53 may be compared with the constructed 
Employment variables HELD31X/42X/53X. Both of these sets of variables provide information on the insurance coverage individuals obtain through their current main jobs. However, these variables may differ since they are constructed from two different data files and because the CMJHLD31/42/53 variables capture information on some additional sources of employment- related insurance that were identified in the insurance section of the instrument 
while the HELD31X/42X/53X variables only contain information on sources of coverage identified in the employment section. In addition, the values of CMJHLD31 for Panel 24 observations reflect coverage in Round 3 in the 2020 PRPL file as well as in the 201 9 PRPL file. 
Note that the variables CMJHLD31/42/53 are included on this file because they were used to perform logical edits on the OFF ER31H/42H/53H and OFEMP31H/42H/53H variables (edits are 
described below). The CMJHLD31H/42H/53H variables were used to edit the OFFER31H/42H/53H and OFEMP31H/42H/53H variables (rather than the HELD31X/42X/53X variables) because they were more consistent wi th the other health insurance variables on the FY 
PUF for each year.  
The following table provides the name of the constructed Employment variables that correspond with each imputed Employment variable.

* Both CMJHLD and HELDX reflect the insurance status at a current main job but are constructed from different sources 
of data. See the text for a description of possible differences in these variables. CMJHLD is not  an imputed version of 
HELDX.  
Imputation Strategy  
The first variables to be imputed were the employment status variables (EMPST31H/42H/53H) 
which identify all persons (EMPST31H/42H/53H = 1 or 2) who should have valid information related to their current main job.  
EMPST31H/42H/53H are created from EMPST31/42/53. The EMPST31/42/53 variables have 
separate response categories for individuals who were “employed during the reference period” and those who were “not employed with no job to return to.” In the imputed variables EMPST31H/42H/53H these responses are collapsed into a single category for analytic purposes. The resulting three responses are mutually exclusive as follows:  
Value  Label  
-1 INAPPLICABLE  
1 EMPLOYED AT RD#/# INT DATE  
2 JOB TO RETURN TO AT RD #/# INT DATE  
34 NOT EMPL AT INT DATE/NOT EMPL DUR RD #/#

Respondents with EMPST31H/42H/53H equal to 1 or 2 go through the imputation process. 
Respondents with EMPST31H/42H/53H equal to -1 or 34 have values of -1 for all remaining 
imputed e mployment variables.  
The next s et of variables to be  imputed w ere the self -employment/wage -earner va riables 
(SLFCM31H/42H/53H) which determine skip patterns for the remaining variables (e.g., self-
employed persons are not asked about wages).  
Many o f the remaining  variables w ere imputed s eparately f or wage- earners and  the self -
employe d for the following reasons: 1) self-employe d and wage- earners w ere asked di fferent  sets 
of questions about their current main jobs; 2) even when variables were asked for both groups, 
the quality of the imputations was improved b y specifying s eparate sets of  class va riables 
tailored to the  wage-earner and  self-employed populations. 
The weighted sequential hot decking process requires class variables to impute missing values. 
These class v ariables w ere identified w ith regress ion models in order to identify the predictive 
quality of a set of variables for each variable to be imputed. The set of possible class variables, 
includes age, sex, region, educational attainment, industry and occupation code, and the set of 
variables ha ve been cons istently us ed to impute a given v ariabl e across p anels. 
As mentioned above, self-employed and wage- earners w ere asked di fferent s ets of que stions  
about their current main job. These variables can be categorized into the following sets: 
Variables with Valid Data for Wage -Earners b ut Not for Self -Employed Individuals 
• Ho
urly wage (HRWG31H, HRWG42H, HRWG53H)
• Paid sick leave (SCPAY31H, SCPAY42H, SCPAY53H)
• Paid leave to visit a doctor (PAYDR31H, PAYDR42H, PAYDR53H)
• Paid vacation (PYVAC31H, PYVAC42H, PYVAC53H)
• Pension plan (RTPLN31H, RTPLN42H, RTPLN53H),
• Business has more than one location (MORE31H, MORE42H, MORE53H)
• Sector: private -foreign govt/federal government/state -local government
(JBORG31H, JBORG42H, JBORG53H)
Variables with Valid Dat a for Self -Employed Individuals but Not for Wage- Earners 
• Business was incorporated, a proprietorship, or a partnership (BSNTY31H,
BSNTY42H, and BSNTY53H)
Variables with Valid Data for All Workers 
• Usual hours worked per week (HOUR31H, HOUR42H, HOUR53H)

• Number of employees (NMEMP31H, NMEMP42H, NMEMP53H) 
– Establishment size for wage -earners  
– Business size for self -employed  
• Union status (UNION31H, UNION42H, UNION53H)  
• Industry category (INDCT31H, INDCT42H, INDCT53H)  
• Occupation category (OCCCT31H, OCCCT42H, OCCCT53H) 
Variables with Valid Data for All Workers Except for Self -Employed Individuals with No 
Employees (i.e., persons for whom SLFCM31H/42H/53H = 1 and NMEMP31H/42H/53H = 
1 within each round)  
• Insurance coverage from current main job (CMJHLD31, CMJHLD42, CM JHLD53)  
• Eligible for insurance offered at current main job (OFFER31H, OFFER42H, OFFER53H)  
• Insurance offered to anyone at current main job (OFEMP31H, OFEMP42H, OFEMP53H)  
Additional Detail on Specific Variables  
Hourly Wage (HRWG31H, HRWG42H, HRWG53H)  
Valid data for imputed hourly wages is available for all wage -earners (SLFCM31H/42H/53H 
equal to 2). The values for the imputed hourly wage variables (HRWG31H/42H/53H) reflect the most up- to-date version of hourly wages for the wage -earner in each round. By contr ast, the 
constructed hourly wage variables (HRWG31X/42X/53X) identify the wage reported in the round a current main job is first reported. Information on any wage changes after that round are contained in the variables DIFFWG31/42/53 and NHRWG31/42/53. The se variables, as well as 
HRWG31X/42X/53X are used in the construction of the imputed hourly wage variables. 
For reasons of confidentiality, the hourly wage variables are top-coded. Like the constructed 
hourly wage variables, imputed hourly wages greater than or equal to $103.36 are top -coded to a 
value of -10.  
Union Membership (UNION31H/42H/53H)  
In addition to using weighted sequential hot-decking techniques, individuals who were identified 
as being employed by the military had their union membership status logically edited to “Inapplicable” (-1).

Health Insurance (
CMJHLD31, CMJHLD42, CMJHLD53, OFFER31H, OFFER42H, OFFER53H, 
OFEMP31H, OFEMP42H, OFEMP53H)  
This file includes several employment -related health insurance variables, CMJHLD31/42/53, 
OFFER31H/42H/53H, and OFEMP31H/42H/53H. These variables are valid for wage- earners 
(SLFCM31H/42H/53H = 2) and self- employed individuals with employees 
(SLFCM31H/42H/53H = 1 and NMEMP31H/42H/53H > 1). 
The variables CMJHLD31/42/53 are constructed from the Pe rson-Round-Plan (PRPL) public use 
file and indicate whether the person held insurance coverage from his/her current main job at 
some point during the round. This is primarily defined using the PRPL public use file variable CMJINS which identifies insurance obtained through a current main job, and STATUS1-24, which indicates whether the coverage is in effect during the round. Since Round 3 crosses two calendar years, CMJHLD31 for Panel 24 respondents indicates that the person held coverage during the portion of Round 3 in either the 2019 or 2020 PRPL public use file for the individual.  
The variables OFFER31H/42H/53H indicate whether the person was offered (was eligible for) 
insurance at their current main job at some point during the round. For records that had a value of -15, valid reported values for OFFER31H/42H/53H were brought forward from a previous round (including imputed values from that round) if the person did not change jobs before any further imputations were performed. 
The variables OFEMP31H/42H/53H indicate whether an employer offered health insurance to 
any employees in the establishment and rely on OFFER31H/42H/53H during their construction. 
OFFER31H/42H/53H and the related variable OFEMP31H/42H/53H were logically edited as 
follows. If a person indicates that they held insurance from their current main job (CMJHLD31/42/53 = 1) then OFFER31H/42H/53H was set equal to 1. For Round 3, OFFER31H/53H was set to 1 if the person held coverage at any point in Round 3 in either the first or second calenda r year  of the round. If a person indicated that they held insurance 
(CMJHLD31/42/53 = 1) or were offered insurance (OFFER31H/42H/53H = 1) at their current main job, then OFEMP31H/42H/53H, the variable indicating that the employer offered insurance to at le ast one employee, was set equal to 1.  
Number of Employees (NMEMP31H, NMEMP42H, NMEMP53H)  
Like the corresponding constructed NUMEMP31/42/53, NMEMP31H/42H/53H indicate the number of employees at the location of the person’s current main job. Due to confident iality 
concerns, this variable has been top-coded at 500. Missing value imputation is done using weighted sequential hot-decking techniques. Note that the definition of NMEMP31H/42H/53H, like that for NUMPEMP31/42/53, differs for wage- earners and self -empl oyed individuals. For 
wage -earners, it represents the size of the worker’s establishment. For self -employed individuals, 
it represents the size of the self -employed individual’s entire business.

Panel  25) or the end of
 the calendar year ( 20). The construction of Panel 23 round- based 
variables is described in the section below on at any time/at interview date/at 12 -31 variables and 
in Appendix 4. 
Beginning Panel 22 Round 3/Panel 23 Round 1, design changes to the health insurance section 
may impact trend analyses. Analysts should note that a series of questions were added to the HX section of the questionnaire to confirm whether a person who did not initially report any comprehensive coverage during a round has insurance. Starting at HX210, questions were 
presented to respondents who at that point in the instrument had not yet reported any sources of health insurance coverage, or only reported a source of health insurance without hospital and physician benefits, to determine whether they had coverage that included hospital and physician benefits. If the respondent answered affirmatively at HX210, subsequent questions identified the specific type of coverage (e.g. Medicaid, Pr ivate, etc.). This may cause analysts to see changes to 
the insurance variables -particularly, changes to the monthly health insurance coverage 
indicators: PUBmmyyX, PRImmyyX, INSmmyyX; and the summary health insurance coverage indicators: UNINSyy, INSCOVyy , INSURCyy, PUBrrX, PUBATrrX, PRIVrr, PRIVATrr, 
INSrrX, and INSATrrX.  
Other changes were made in FY 2018 to the health insurance questions that may affect the continuity of estimates. These changes include modifications to the Medicaid/SCHIP, and TRICARE/ CHAMPVA questions to ask if each person in the household is covered using the 
person’s name in the question text (e.g. “Was Person 1 covered?” “What about Person 2?” etc.). Additionally, in Rounds 2 and 3, respondents are now required to answer “Yes” or “N o” for each 
person individually when reviewing coverage from a previous round for these insurance sources. Changes to the Medicare Round 1 series were also made to probe separately for persons in the RU who were 65 years of age or older versus RU members who were under 65 years of age. Similar to the Medicaid and TRICARE series, Medicare coverage questions were asked for each RU member who was at least 65 years old. 
The aforementioned changes to the administration of the insurance section may also be evident 
in the Managed Care Variables (TRISTyyX -PRVHMOyy) because more respondents are now 
more likely to be asked about managed care. 
Respondents were allowed to simultaneously report Medicaid and other public hospital/physician 
coverage. Analysts should be aware that they might see changes in coverage trends in the constructed variables relating to Medicaid, edited Medicaid, or Other Public coverage as well as respondents reporting both after FY 2018.  
The variables VERFLG31, VERFLG42, and VERFLGyy indicate the round in which 
comprehensive health insurance coverage was first reported through the verification series of questions collected in the loop that starts at HX210 (HXLoop_40). These values will be carried through to subsequent rounds (e.g., from VERFLG31 t o VERFLG42) if the coverage initially 
added through the verification loop continues, and no other comprehensive source of coverage is reported for that person outside of the verification loop. If previously reported coverage through the verification series  ends and, in a future round, new comprehensive coverage is reported 
through the verification loop, then the VERFLG31/42/yy variable will reflect the corresponding round of the newly reported coverage. The VERFLG variables were set to ‘95’ to indicate that : 
C-95 MEPS HC -224 


================================================================================
PÁGINA 104
================================================================================

1) coverage was
 reported outside verification; 2) the person did not have coverage; or 3) the 
person would have been assigned edited coverage even though they may have reported coverage 
in the verification loop. As an example of the latter, a person who is age 65 or older and reports Medicare coverage through verification but also reports receipt of social security would have MCAREX set to ‘1’ because of the report of social security so the report of coverage in the verification module would not have changed their coverage status in the MEPS. In FY 2019, the construction of the VERFLG variables was modified such that all persons ages 65 and older who gained edited Medicare through the Medicare coverage of their spouse also have a value of 95 in the verific ation variables, provided that the coverage of the spouse was added outside of the 
verification series.  
Persons who report coverage under Indian Health Service (IHS) are identified in the constructed variables IHSrr, IHSATrr, and IHSmmyy. Persons reporting only IHS coverage are not  
considered covered for the summary insurance measures PUBmmyyX, PUByyX, INSmmyyX, INSCOVyy, and INSURCyy. Persons who report coverage under Veteran’s Administration (VA) can be identified in this file in the constructed variables VAPROGrr, VAPRATrr, VAEVyy, as well as the monthly variables VAPRmmyy.  
Monthly Health Insurance Indicators (TRIJAyyX -INSDEyyX)  
Constructed and edited variables are provided that indicate any coverage in each month of 2020 for the sources of health insurance coverage collected during the MEPS interviews (Panel 23 Rounds 6 and 7, Panel 24 Rounds 3 through 5, and Panel 25  Rounds 1 through 3). In Rounds 2, 
3, 4, and 5, insurance that was in effect at the previous round’s inter view date was reviewed with 
the respondent. Because Panel 23 Round 6 was an unexpected extension to the 2020 data collection, insurance in effect in 2020 was not reviewed at the Round 5 interview date, and instead at the Round 6 interview. Most of the insu rance variables have been logically edited to 
address issues that arose during such reviews in Rounds 2, 3, 4, and 5, and an additional edit corrected for the lack of existing insurance review for Panel 23 cases . One edit to the private 
insurance variables  corrects for a problem concerning covered benefits that occurred when 
respondents reported a change in any of their private health insurance plan names. Additional edits address issues of missing data on the time period of coverage for both public and pri vate 
coverage that was either reviewed or initially reported in a given round. Other  edits, described 
below, were performed on the Medicare and Medicaid or State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) variables to assign persons to coverage from these sources. Observations that contain edits assigning persons to Medicare or Medicaid/SCHIP coverage can be identified by comparing the edited and unedited versions of the Medicare and Medicaid/SCHIP variables. Starting October 1, 2001, persons 65 years and older have been able to retain TRICARE coverage in addition to Medicare. Therefore, unlike in earlier MEPS public use files, persons 65 years and older do not have their reported TRICARE coverage (TRIJAyyX - TRIDEyyX) overturned. TRICARE acts as a suppleme ntal insurance for Medicare, similar to Medigap 
insurance. 
Public sources include Medicare, TRICARE/CHAMPVA, Medicaid, SCHIP, and other public 
hospital/physician coverage. IHS is not included as a public source of coverage.

Medicare  
Medicare (MCRJAyy - MCR DEyy) coverage was edited (MCRJAyyX - MCRDEyyX) for 
persons age 65 or over. Within this age group, individuals were assigned Medicare coverage if: 
• They answered “Yes” to a follow-up question on whether they received Social 
Security benefits; or  
• They were covered by Medicaid/SCHIP, other public hospital/physician coverage or 
Medigap coverage; or 
• Their spouse was age 65 or over and covered by Medicare; or 
• They reported TRICARE coverage. 
Note that age (AGErrX) is checked for edited Medicare, however date of birth is not considered. Edited Medicare is somewhat imprecise with regard to a person’s 65
th birthday.  
Medicaid/SCHIP and Other Public Hospital/Physician Coverage  
Questions about other public hospital/physician coverage were asked in an attempt to identi fy 
Medicaid or SCHIP recipients who may not have recognized their coverage as such. Beginning Panel 22 Round 3/Panel 23 Round 1, these questions were asked even if a respondent reported Medicaid or SCHIP directly. (Previously, other public hospital/physici an coverage was only 
asked for respondents who did not report Medicaid or SCHIP.) Respondents reporting other public hospital/physician coverage were asked follow-up questions to determine if the coverage was through a specific Medicaid HMO or if it included some other managed care characteristics. Respondents who identified managed care from either source were asked if the recipient paid anything for the coverage and/or if a government source paid for the coverage.  
The Medicaid/SCHIP variables (MCDJAyy - MCDDEyy) have been edited (MCDJAyyX - 
MCDDEyyX) to include persons who paid nothing for their other public hospital/physician insurance when such coverage was through a Medicaid HMO or reported to include some other managed care characteristics.  
To assist u sers in further editing sources of insurance, this file contains variables constructed 
from the other public hospital/physician series that indicate: 
• Respondents who reported coverage through other public hospital/physician insurance (GVAJAyy - GVADEyy);  
• Respondents who reported coverage through other public hospital/physician 
insurance and the source was identified as an HMO or the source of coverage 
required the covered person to sign up with a doctor or clinic (GVBJAyy - GVBDEyy)  
• Respondents who reported coverage through other public hospital/physician insurance and the person pays a monthly premium for this coverage (GVCJAyy - GVCDEyy)

The variables GVAJA
yy - GVADEyy, GVBJAyy - GVBDEyy, and GVCJAyy - GVCDEyy are

these types of insurance categories.  
Any Public Insurance in Month  
The file also includes summary measures that indicate whether or not a sample person has any public insurance in a month (PUBJAyyX - PUBDEyyX). Persons identified as covered by public insurance are those reporting coverage under TRICARE, Medicare, Medicaid or SCHIP, other public hospital/physician programs, or Veteran’s Administration (VA). IHS is not included as a public source of coverage. Note that further edits may be made to the public insurance variables in later MEPS data releases to address cases where private coverage through a federally -
facilitated, state -based or state partnership exchange/marketplace may have been originally  
reported as public insurance. These potential edits could affect the variables MCAIDyyX, GOVTAyy, GOVTByy, GOVTCyy, and PUByyX.

PRXDEyy) were constructed. Private insurance sources identify coverage in effect at any time during each month of 2020. Separate variables beginning with the letter “H”  identify 
policyholders (e.g., HPEJAyy - HPEDEyy). Both types of variables indicate coverage or 
policyholder status for a particular source and do not identify  persons who may have  more than 
one policy of  a given source. F or example, these variables do not allow users to identify someone 
who is a policyholder for one employer/union group plan and also a dependent on another employer/union group plan held by his/her spouse) . In some cases, the respondent was unable to 
characterize the source of insurance (PDKJAyy - PDKDEyy).  
PRIEUOrr indicates coverage from a policyholder living outside the R U where the source is 
through an employer, and PRINEOrr indicates coverage from a policyholder living outside the 
RU where the source is not through an employer. These variables are based on responses to a 
follow-up question for respondents who indicate coverage from a policyholder outside the household. The question HP130 asks “Is the {INSURANCE SOURCE NAME} health coverage {POLICYHOLDER} has through an employer or previous employer?” If the respondent’s answer to HP130 was unknown, the person’s coverage is now included in PRIDKrr.  
An individual was considered to have private health insurance coverage if, at a minimum, that 
coverage provided benefits for hospital and physician services (including Medicare supplemental coverage). Note, however, that persons covered by private insurance through an exchange/marketplace (PRSTXrr and PRXJAyy - PRXDEyy) were considered to have private 
health coverage if that coverage provided hospital/physician services, but excluded coverage that was explicitly identified as Med icare supplemental coverage (HX620/OE130=5). If a person 
reported Medicare supplemental coverage through the exchange/marketplace, then the source of the insurance purchased was edited to reflect coverage “from a professional association” (HP40=1) or coverage “from a group or association” (HX200/HX300=1). Further descriptions of the exchange variables are detailed below. Sources of insurance with missing information

regarding the
 type of coverage were assumed to contain hospital/physician coverage. Persons 
who reported private insurance that did not provide hospital/physician insurance were not 
counted as privately insured. Coverage indicated by these variables may be from any type of job whereas the employment section insurance variables delivered on this file reflect only coverage through a current main job. 
Health insurance through a job or union (PEGJAyy - PEGDEyy) was initially asked about in the 
Employment S ection of the interview and later confirmed in the Health Insurance S ection .  
Insurance that was reported in the employment section through a job classified as self-employed 
with firm size of 1 is included in the other private insurance variables based on responses at HP40 : PEGJAyy - PEGDEyy; PNGJAyy - PNGDEyy; POGJAyy - POGDEyy; PDKJAyy -
PDKDEyy; HPEJAyy -HPEDEyy; HPNJAyy -HPNDEyy; HPOJAyy -HPODEyy; HPDJAyy -
HPDDEyy; and PRIEUrr, PRINGrr, PRIOGrr, and PRIDKrr.  
Private insurance that was not employment -related (POGJAyy - POGDEyy, PNGJAyy - 
PNGDEyy, PDKJAyy - PDKDEyy, PNEJAyy - PNEDEyy, and PRXJAyy - PRXDEyy) was 
reported in the Health Insurance section only. 
“Federal/State Exchange” is included in the list of private insurance categories (HP40=8 and 
HX200/HX300 =11). Information on federal/state exchanges is also collected at question HP50 (“Is this coverage through {state exchange name}?”) for respondents reporting insurance from a group, directly from an insurance company or HMO, from an insurance agent or from an “other” unspecified source and at OE40 in Round 3 only (“Is thi s coverage through {state exchange 
name}?”) for respondents who previously reported private insurance coverage from an insurance company or HMO, or from an insurance agent that was not through an exchange/marketplace. Note that the state -specific name for the exchange/marketplace was used when asking these 
questions and was also used on the list of private insurance categories at HP40, HX200, and HX300. The variables PRSTXrr have been constructed to include persons less than 65 years old who report private insurance through a federally- facilitated, state -based or state partnership 
exchange/marketplace at HP40, HX200, or HX300, or persons 65 years old or older who report private insurance through a federally- facilitated, state -based or state partnership 
exchange/marketplace at HP40, HX200, or HX300 and who were not covered by Medicare. In addition, persons who reported a source of insurance at HX200 or HX300 that was not through an exchange/marketplace (e.g. through a group or directly from an insurance company) but who answered yes to HP50 or OE40 were also classified as having exchange/marketplace coverage instead of being assigned to the category they originally reported. In addition to reporting coverage through an exchange/marketplace, coverage needed to have been identified as hospital/physician coverage at HX620/OE130 (=1 or missing ( -7, -8)), but not identified as having Medicare supplemental coverage (HX620/OE130=5). The variables PRSTXrr contain information on private coverage that was reported as obt ained through a federally -facilitated, 
state-based or state partnership marketplace. Consistent with the approach used in the Current 
Population Survey and the National Health Interview Survey, MEPS respondents reporting public coverage were asked whether the public coverage was obtained through a federal or state marketplace in case respondents were confused about whether the source of coverage was public or private. Responses to these questions were not used to edit the PRSTXrr variables.

Any Insurance in  Month  
The file also includes summary measures that indicate whether or not a person has any insurance 
in a month (INSJAyyX - INSDEyyX). Persons identified as insured are those reporting coverage under TRICARE, Medicare, Medicaid, SCHIP, other public hospi tal/physician or private 
hospital/physician insurance (including Medigap plans), or Veteran’s Administration (VA). A person is considered uninsured if not covered by one of these insurance sources. IHS is not included as a source of coverage. 
Summary Insur ance Coverage Indicators (PRVEVyy- INSURCyy)  
The variables PRVEVyy -UNINSyy summarize health insurance coverage for the person in 2020 
for the following types of insurance: private (PRVEVyy); TRICARE/CHAMPVA (TRIEVyy); Medicaid or SCHIP (MCDEVyy); Medicare (MCREVyy); other public coverage (GVAEVyy); 
other public coverage that is an HMO (GVBEVyy); other public coverage where a premium is paid (GVCEVyy). Each variable was constructed based on the values of the corresponding 12 month- by-month health insurance variables described above. For persons not in scope for the full 
year, these summary variables are based on the period of eligibility. If the person was not in 
scope for all 12 months throughout the year, the values are based on the months the person was eligible. A value of 1 indicates that the person was covered for at least one day of at least one month during 2020. A value of 2 indicates that the person was not covered for a given type of insurance for all of 2020. The variable UNINSyy summarizes PRVEVyy -GVAEVyy. Where 
PRVEVyy -GVAEVyy are all equal to 2, then UNINSyy equals 1, person was uninsured for all 
of 2020. Otherwise, UNINSyy is set to 2, insured for all or part of 2020.  
For user convenience, this file contains a constructed variable INSCOVyy that summarizes 
health insurance coverage for the person in 2020, with the following three values:  
1 = ANY PRIVATE (Person had any private insurance coverage [including 
TRIC ARE/CHAMPVA] any time during 2 020)  
2 = PUBLIC ONLY (Person had only public insurance coverage [excluding 
 TRICARE/CHAMPVA] during 2020)  
3 = UNINSURED (Person  was uninsured during all of 2020)  
INSURCyy summarizes health insurance coverage for the person in 2020 using eight categories  
of insurance separated by age using the person’s age on December 31
st, 2020: 
1 = ANY PRIVATE (0 -64) (Person is between 0 and 64 years old and is covered by private 
insurance or TRICARE/CHAMPVA in 2020 ) 
2 = PUBLIC ONLY (0 -64) (Person is between 0 and 64 years old and is covered by public 
insurance only (excluding TRICARE/CHAMPVA) in 2020) 
3 = UNINSURED (0 -64) (Person is between 0 and 64 years old and is uninsured for all of 
2020)

4 = EDITED MEDICARE ONLY (65+) (Person is 65 years old or more and is covered by 
edited Medicare only in 2020) 
5 = EDITED MEDICARE & PRIV (65+) (Person is 65 years old or more and is covered by 
edited Medicare and private insurance or TRICARE/CHAMPVA  in 2020) 
6 = EDITED MEDICARE & OTH PUB ONLY (65+) (Person is 65 years old or more and 
is covered by edited Medicare and  public insurance including edited Medicaid/SCHIP or 
other public coverage but excluding TRICARE/CHAMPVA in 2020) 7 = UNINSURED (65+) (Person is 65 years old or more and is uninsured for all of 2020) 
8 = NO MEDICARE BUT ANY PUBLIC/PRIVATE (65+) (Person is 65 years old or more 
and is not covered by Medicare but is covered by private insurance, Medicaid, 
TRICARE/CHAMPVA, Veteran’s Administration, or other public coverage in 2020) 
Please note, beginning in 2012, Category 7 was revised to categorize persons who are 65 years or older and uninsured, and Category 8 was added to include persons 65 years or older who do not have Medicare, but are covered by public or private insurance.  
Please note that IHS is not included as a so urce of coverage for either INSCOVyy or 
INSURCyy.  
Please note that both INSCOVyy and INSURCyy categorize TRICARE as private coverage. All 
other health insurance indicators included in this data release categorize TRICARE as public coverage. If an analyst w ishes to consider TRICARE public coverage, the variable can easily be 
reconstructed using the PRVEVyy and TRIEVyy variables. Also note that these categories are mutually exclusive, with preference given to private insurance and TRICARE. Persons with both private insurance/TRICARE and public insurance will be coded as “1” for INSCOVyy and INSURCyy.  
Users wishing to compare INSCOVyy and INSURCyy across years should note at least two changes beginning in 2018 that may affect the continuity of estimates: 1) in creased reports of 
coverage due to the inclusion of the coverage verification series; and 2) the inclusion of Veteran’s Administration coverage as a public coverage source.  
Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAGT31 -PFSAMT31)  
Respondents in Round 1 or Round 3 wer e asked if any RU members set aside pre-tax dollars of 
their own money to pay for out-of- pocket health care expenses. If an RU has a Flexible Spending 
Account (FSA), then FSAGT31 was set to 1 (Yes), and two follow-up questions were asked - HASFSA31 and PFSAMT31. HASFSA31 was set for each RU member to indicate which RU member has an FSA. The constructed variable PFSAMT31 indicates the total amount the individual RU member contributed to his or her FSA. If no RU member has an FSA, then both HASFSA31 and PFSAM T31 are set to - 1 (Inapplicable). Because the FSA questions were not 
asked of Panel 23 respondents in 2020, all 2020 FSA variables are set to -1 for Panel 23 data. See Appendix 3 for a description of the rounds and variables for the 2020 Panel 23 data.

Unedited Health Insurance Variables (PREVCOVR -MORECOVR)  
Duration of Uninsurance  
If a person was identified as being without insurance as of January 1st in the MEPS Round 1 
interview, a series of  follow-up questions was  asked to determine the duration of uninsurance 
prior to the start of the MEPS survey. Persons who were insured as of January 1st, and persons 
with a date of birth on or after December 31, 2020 or whose age category was less than 1 year 
old were skipped past this loop of questions. These questions are asked in Round 1 only.  
PREVCOVR indicates if the person was covered by insurance in the two years prior to the 
MEPS Round 1 interview. For persons who reported only non- comprehensive coverage as of 
January 1st, a question was asked to determine if they had been covered by more comprehensive coverage that paid for medical and doctors’ bills in the previous two years (MORECOVR).  
Note that these variables are unedited and have been taken directly as they were recorded from 
the raw data. There may b e inconsistencies with the health insurance variables released on public 
use files that indicate that an individual is uninsured in January. Out-of-scope persons in both panels have been set to “Inapplicable” ( -1) for PREVCOVR and MORECOVR. All other 
perso ns have PREVCOVR and MORECOVR copied directly from the value of the unedited 
source variable.  
Persons whose January 1
st insurance coverage status could not be determined due to their 
reference period beginning after January 1st were also asked the follow-up questions described 
above. In these cases, persons who reported comprehensive coverage were asked if they were 
ever without insurance. Those who were uninsured were asked to determine the duration of uninsurance prior to the start of their reference period. Those who reported only non-comprehensive coverage were asked if they had been covered by comprehensive coverage that paid for medical and doctors’ bills in the previous two years. Coverage is determined by health insurance status during the whole reference period or the month of January and ignores that these persons were not in the household on January 1
st. 
Health Insurance Coverage Variables - At Any Time/At Interview Date/At 12 -31 Variables 
(TRICR31X -INSATyyX)  
Constructed and edited variables are provided that indicate health insurance coverage at any time in a given round, as well as at the MEPS interview dates and on December 31, 2020. Note that for persons who left the RU before the MEPS interview date or before December 31
st, the 
variables measu ring coverage at the interview date or on December 31st represent coverage at the 
date the person left the RU.  
Variables indicating coverage for Panel 2 4 members for any time in the round that end in “31” 
indicate coverage for the portion of Round 3 that occurred in calendar year 2020, unless noted 
otherwise (see “Dental and Prescription Drug Private Insurance” section). Variables indicating coverage for Panel 2 5 members ending in “53” indicate coverage at any time in Round 3, 
including the portion of the round that occurred in calendar year 2021. For Round 3 coverage for Panel 2 5 members that occurred in calendar year 20 20, users should use variables ending in 
“yy”. Because the 2020 data collection included only two rounds for Panel 23 - an extended

Round 6 and a standard round leng
th for Round 7 - the Panel 23 Round 6 data are stored in both 
the 31 and 42 variables, while the Panel 23 Round 7 data are stored in the 53 and 20 variables. 
Thus, variables ending in “53” indicate coverage at any time in Panel 2 4 Round 5 or Panel 23 
Round 7, including the portion of the round that occurred in calendar year 2021. For Round 5 coverage for Panel 24 members or Round 7 coverage for Panel 23 members that occurred in calendar year 2020, users should use variables ending in “yy”. Additional information on modifications to the standard 31 and 42 variables to accommodate the Panel 23 data is described in Appendix 4. 
The health insurance variables are constructed for the sources of health insurance coverage 
collected during the MEPS interviews ( Panel 23 Rounds 6 and 7, Panel 2 4 Rounds 3 through 5, 
and Panel 2 5 Rounds 1 through 3). Note that the Medicare variables on this file as well as the 
private insurance variables that indicate the particular source of private coverage (rather than any private coverage) only measure coverage at the interview date and on December 31
st. Users 
should also note that the same general editing rules were followed for the month- by-month 
health insurance variables released on this public use file ( see the s ection “Monthly Health 
Insurance Indicators” for details). Editing programs checking for consistencies between these sets of variables were developed in order to provide as much consistency as possible between the round-specific indicators and the month- by-month indicators of insurance.  
Public sources include Medicare, TRICARE, Veteran’s Administration (VA), Medicaid/SCHIP, and other public hospital/physician coverage. IHS was not considered a public coverage source. 
See Appendix 4 for a descripti on of the rounds and variables for the 2020 Panel 23 data. 
Medicare  
Medicare coverage variables (MCARErr) and the edited versions of these variables 
(MCARErrX) were constructed similarly to the month -by-month Medicare variables. Since 
Medicare coverage is logically edited to continue for a person once it has been reported in MEPS, the Medicare coverage variables can be considered as either “coverage at any time in the round” or “coverage at the interview date” variables .The same caveats as noted above regar ding

variables and restrictions on Round 3, Round 5, and Round 7 coverage to reflect coverage in 2020 should be applied to the Medicare variables.

Medicaid/SCHIP variables (MCAIDrr) and the edited versions of these variables (MCAIDrrX 
and MCDATrrX) were constructed similarly to the month -by-month Medicaid/SCHIP variables.

Private Insurance  
Variables identifying private insurance in general (PRIVrr and PRIVATrr) and specific private 
insurance sources (such as employer/union group insurance [PRIEUrr]; other group coverage [PRIOGrr]; coverage through an unknown private category [PRIDKrr]; coverage from a policyholder living outside the RU that is employer based coverage [PRIEUOrr]; coverage from a policyholder living outside the RU that is not employer- based coverage [PRINEOrr];  and 
coverage through an exchange /marketplace  [PRSTXrr]) were constructed similarly to the month -
by-month variables in the s ection “Monthly Health Insurance Indi cators.” Variables indicating 
any private insurance coverage are available for the following time periods: at any time in a given round, at the interview date, and on December 31
st. The variables for the specific sources 
of private coverage are only available for coverage on the interview dates and on December 31st.

FY 2020  PUF Managed Care Variables (TRIST 31X- PRVHMOyy)  
In addition to the month- by-month indicators of coverage, there are round- specific health 
insurance variables indicating coverage by an HMO or managed care plan. Managed care 
variables have been constructed from information on health insurance coverage at any time in a reference period and the characteristics of the plan. A separate set of managed care variables has been constructed for private insurance, Medicaid/SCHIP, and Medicare coverage. The purpose of these variables is to provide information on managed care participation during the portion of the three rounds (i.e., reference periods) that fall within the same calendar year. 
Managed care variables for calendar year 2020 are based on responses to health insurance 
questions asked during the Round 6 and 7 interviews of Panel 23, the Round 3, 4, and 5 interviews of Panel 2 4, and the Round 1, 2, and 3 interviews of Panel 25. Each managed care 
variable ends in “rr” where the fi rst r denotes the interview round for Panel 24 and the second r 
denotes the round for Panel 25, respectively. The variables ending in “31” and “42” correspond to the first two interviews of each panel in the calendar year. Because Round 3 interviews typica lly overlap the final months of one year and the beginning months of the next year, the 
“31” managed care variables for Panel s 23 and 24 indicate whether or not a person has coverage 
from a managed care plan in the 2020 calendar year. Similarly, the Panel 23 Round 7, Panel 2 4 
Round 5 and Panel 25 Round 3 managed care variables indicate whether or not a person has coverage from a managed care plan in the 2020 calendar year, and the variables have been given the suffix “yy” (as opposed to “53”) to emphasize t he restricted time frame. See below in this 
section  for a description  of the rounds and variables for the 2020 Panel 23 data. Further 
descriptions of the implications to managed care plan coverage due to the overlapping calendar year in Round 3 are detailed below. 
Construction of the managed care variables is straightforward, but three caveats are appropriate. 
First, MEPS estimates of the number of persons in HMOs are higher than figures reported by 
 C-104 MEPS HC -224 
 


================================================================================
PÁGINA 113
================================================================================

other sources, pa
rticularly those based on HMO industry da ta. The differences stem from the use 
of household-reported information, which may include respondent error, to determine HMO 
coverage in MEPS. 
Second, the managed care questions are asked about the last plan held by a person through his or 
her establishme nt (employer or insurer) even though the person could have had a different plan 
through the establishment at an earlier point during the interview period. As a result, in instances where a person changed his or her establishment- related insurance, the managed care variables 
describe the characteristics of the last plan held through the establishment.  
Third, the “yy” versions of the managed care variables are developed from Rounds 3, 5, and 7 variables that cover different time frames. Health insurance statu s variables for Round 3 are 
restricted to the same calendar year as the Round 1 and 2 data. The Rounds 3, 5, and 7 variables describing plan type, on the other hand, overlap the next calendar year, 2021. As a consequence, the “yy”  managed care variables ma y not describe the characteristics of the last plan held in the 
calendar year if the person changed plans after the first of the year.   
The variables PRVHMOrr indicate coverage by a private HMO in Panel 2 5 Rounds 1 - 3, Panel 
24 Rounds 3 - 5, and Panel 23 Rounds 6 and 7. The variables MCRPHOrr indicate coverage by a Medicare managed care plan (or “Medicare Advantage” plan) in Panel 2 5 Rounds 1 - 3, Panel 24 
Rounds 3 - 5, and Panel 23 Rounds 6 and 7. The variables MCRPDrr indicate coverage by Medicare prescr iption drug benefit, also known as Part D, in Panel 25 Rounds 1 - 3, Panel 24 
Rounds 3 - 5, and Panel 23 Rounds 6 and 7. The edited version of the Medicare prescription drug coverage variables (MCRPDrrX) include persons who are covered by both edited Medic are and 
edited Medicaid. The variables MCDHMOrr and MCDMCrr indicate coverage by a Medicaid or SCHIP HMO or managed care plan in Panel 2 5 Rounds 1 - 3, Panel 24 Rounds 3 - 5, and Panel 
23 Rounds 6 and 7. The Tricare plan variables are similarly defined.   
For Panel 2 5, the “31” version indicates coverage at any time in Round 1, the “42” version 
indicates coverage at any time in Round 2, and the “yy” version represents coverage at any time during the 2020 portion of Round 3. For Panel 24, the “31” version indicates coverage at any time during the 2020 portion of Round 3, the “42” version indicates coverage at any time in Round 4, and the “yy” version represents coverage at any time during the 2020 portion of Round 5. For Panel 2 3, the “31” version indicates coverage at any time from January 1st through 
the Round 5 interview date, the “42” version indicates coverage at any time in Round 6 after the Round 5 interview date, and “yy” version represents coverage at any time during the 2020 portion of Round 7. See Appendix 4 for a discussion of the rounds and variables for the 2020 Panel 23 data.  
In the health insurance section of the questionnaire, respondents reporting private health insurance were asked to identify what types of coverage a person had via a checkli st. If the 
respondent selected prescription drug or dental coverage from this checklist, variables were constructed to indicate prescription drug or dental coverage respectively. It should be noted, however, that in some cases respondents may have failed to identify prescription drug or dental coverage that was included as part of a hospital and physician plan.

TRICARE Plan Variables  
Round-specific variables are provided that indicate which TRICARE plan the person was 
covered by for each round of 2020. Thes e variables indicate whether the person was covered by 
TRICARE Standard (TRISTrrX), TRICARE Prime (TRIPRrrX), TRICARE Extra (TRIEXrrX), and TRICARE for Life (TRILIrrX). Beginning in Panel 9 Rounds 4 and 5/Panel 10 Rounds 1 through 3, CHAMPVA was added to t he list of TRICARE/CHAMPVA Plans collected in the 
instrument. Therefore, the variables TRICH42/yyX were created. The “31” version of this variable was constructed starting in 2006. It should be noted that the TRICARE Plan information was elicited from a pick -list, code- all-that-apply question that asked which type of TRICARE 
plan the person obtained. Beginning Panel 22 Round 3/Panel 23 Round 1, questions related to military health coverage were asked at the person -level. If it was reported that someone in t he 
RU had coverage through military health care, a follow-up question was asked to determine who in the RU was covered; then, the pick-list, code- all-that-apply question described above was 
asked to determine which type of military coverage the person obta ined. VA (Veteran’s 
Administration) was added to this list beginning Panel 22 Round 3/Panel 23 Round 1. 
In each round, each TRICARE Plan variable has four possible values:  
1 The person was covered by the applicable TRICARE plan [Standard, Prime, 
Extra, F or Life, or CHAMPVA].  
2 The person was covered by TRICARE, but it was not through that particular plan [Standard, Prime, Extra, For Life, or CHAMPVA].  
3  The person was not covered by TRICARE.  
-1 The person was out-of-scope. 
Medicare Managed Care Pla ns, Part B, and Prescription Drug Benefit  
Persons were assigned Medicare coverage based on their responses to the health insurance questions or through logical editing of the survey data. A small number of persons were edited to have Medicare. For this group, coverage through a managed care plan, Part B, and coverage by prescription drug plan questions were not asked. Since no Medicare establishment -person pair 
exists for this group, the persons’ Medicare managed care, Part B, and prescription drug benefit 
statuses are set to -15 (Cannot be Computed). For those persons who reported Medicare coverage 
based on their responses to the health insurance questions, the Medicare managed care plan, Part B, and prescription drug benefit questions were asked. Medicare managed care plan and 
prescription drug benefit questions were asked for each round a person indicates Medicare coverage. Medicare Part B questions were asked during the first report of Medicare only. The Medicare Part B indicator for those persons who indicated not having a Medicare card available was introduced for Panel 14 Round 2 and Panel 13 Round 4. For those persons who reported having Medicare coverage in Round 1, but did not have a Medicar e card available, Medicare 
Part B coverage was set to -15 (Cannot be Computed). 
The Medicare prescription drug benefit variables (MCRPDrr) have been edited (MCRPDrrX) to turn on coverage for all persons who are covered by both edited Medicare and edited Medicaid regardless of the status on their unedited Medicare prescription drug benefit variable.

These persons indicated coverage through an Other Government program that was identified as being in a Medicaid HMO or gatekeeper plan that did not require premium payment from the insured party. By definition, respondents were asked about the managed care characteristics of this insurance coverage.

Medicaid/SCHIP HMOs  
If Medicaid/SCHIP or Other Government programs were identified as the source of 
hospital/physician insurance coverage, the respondent was asked about the characteristics of the plan. The variables MCDHMOrr were set to “Yes” if an affirmative response was provided to the following question: 
Under {{Medicaid/{STATE NAME FOR MEDICAID}} or {S TATE CHIP 
NAME}/{PROGRAM NAME FROM HX160/HX270}, the program sponsored by a state or local government agency which provides hospital and physician benefits,} {{are/is}/{were/was}} {PERSON 1}, {PERSON 2}, {PERSON 3}, {PERSON  4}, 
{PERSON N} enrolled in an HM O, that is a Health Maintenance Organization 
{between {START DATE} and {END DATE}}?  
[With an HMO, you must generally receive care from HMO physicians. If another doctor is seen, the expense is not covered unless you were referred by the HMO, or there was a medical emergency.]
 
In subsequent rounds, for persons who had been previously identified as covered by Medicaid, the respondent was asked whether the name of the person’s insurance plan had changed since the previous interview. An affirmative response triggered the previous set of questions about managed care (name on list of Medicaid HMOs or signed up with an HMO). 
In each round, the variables MCDHMOrr have five possible values: 
1  The person was covered by a Medicaid/SCHIP HMO.  
2  The person was covered by Medicaid/SCHIP but the plan was not an HMO.  
3  The person was not covered by Medicaid/SCHIP.  
-15 The person was covered by Medicaid/SCHIP but the plan type cannot be 
computed.  
-1 The person was out-of-scope.  
Medicaid/SCHIP Gatekeeper Plans  
If a person did not belong to a Medicaid/SCHIP HMO, a third question was used to determine whether the person was in a gatekeeper plan. The variables MCDMCrr were set to “Yes” if the respondent provided an affirmative response to the following question: 
{Does/Between {START DATE} and {END DATE}, did} {{Medicaid/{STATE NAME FOR MEDICAID}} or{STATE CHIP NAME}/{PROGRAM NAME FROM HX160/HX270}, the program sponsored by a state or local government agency which provides hospital and physician benefits,} require {PERSON 1}, {PERSON 2},  {PERSON 3}, {PERSON 4}, {PERSON N} to sign up with a certain primary care doctor, group of doctors, or with a certain clinic which they must go to for all of their routine care?

In each round, the variables MCDMCrr have five possible values: 
1  The person was covered by a Medicaid/SCHIP gatekeeper plan.  
2  The person was covered by Medicaid/SCHIP, but it was not a gatekeeper plan.  
3  The person was not covered by Medicaid/SCHIP.  
-15 The person was covered by Medicaid/SCHIP but the plan type cannot be 
computed.  
-1 The person was out-of-scope.  
Private Managed Care Plans 
Persons with private insurance were identified from their responses to questions in the health 
insurance section of the MEPS questionnaire. In some cases, persons were assigned private insurance as a result of comments collected during the interview, but data editing was minimal. As a consequence, most persons with private insurance were asked about the characteristics of their plan, and their responses were used to identify HMO and gatekeeper plans. 
Private HMOs  
Persons with private insurance were classified as being covered by an  HMO if they met any of 
the three following conditions: 
1. The person reported that his or her insurance was purchased directly through an 
HMO,  
2. The person reporting private insurance coverage identified the type of insurance company as an HMO, or 
3. The person answered “Yes” to the following question: 
{Is/Was} {your/{POLICYHOLDER}'s} {NAME OF INSURER} an HMO {as of {END DATE}}? {When answering this question, do not consider {your/his/her} insurance through Medicare.}  
[With an HMO, you must generally receive car e from HMO physicians. For other 
doctors, the expense is not covered unless you were referred by the HMO or there 
was a medical emergency.]  
In subsequent rounds, policyholders were asked whether the name of their insurance plan had 
changed since the previo us interview. An affirmative response triggered the detailed question 
about managed care (i.e., was the insurer an HMO).  
Some insured persons have more than one private plan. In these cases, if the policyholder 
identified any plan as an HMO, the variables PRVHMOrr were set to “Yes.” If a person had multiple plans and one or more were identified as not being an HMO and the other(s) had missing plan type information, the person- level variable was set to missing. Additionally, if a

person had multiple plans and none were identified as an HMO, the person- level variable was set 
to “No.” In each round, the variables PRVHMOrr have five possible values: 
1  The person was covered by a private HMO.  
2  The person was covered by private insurance, but it was not an H MO.  
3  The person was not covered by private insurance.  
-15 The person was covered by private insurance, but the plan type cannot be 
computed.  
-1 The person was out-of-scope.  
Dental and Prescription Drug Private Insurance Variables (DENTIN31- PMDINSy y) 
Dental Private Insurance Variables  
Round- specific variables (DENTINrr) are provided that indicate the person was covered by a 
private health insurance plan that included at least some dental coverage for each round of 2020. Information was elicited from a pick -list, code- all-that-apply, question that asked what type of 
health insurance a person obtained through an establishment. The list included: hospital and physician benefits including coverage through an HMO, Medigap coverage, vision coverage, dental , and prescription drugs. It is possible that respondents did not independently enumerate 
some dental coverage provided by hospital and physician plans. Users should also note that persons with missing information on dental benefits for all reported private plans and those who reported that they did not have dental coverage for one or more plans but had missing information on other plans are coded as not having private dental coverage. Persons with reported dental coverage from at least one reported private plan were coded as having private dental coverage.  
DENTIN53 reflects coverage for all of Panel 2 5 Round 3, all of Panel 24 Round 5, and all of 
Panel 23 Round 7 where the end reference year could extend into 2021. DENTIN31 for Panel 24 Round 3 reflects coverage in 2019 and 2020 since the Round 3 reference period spans both years. A second version of these dental coverage indicators was built to reflect only current year coverage (DNTINS rr).  
See Appendix 4 for a description of the rounds and variables for the 2020 Panel 23 data. 
Prescription Drug Private Insurance Variables  
Round- specific variables (PMEDINrr) are provided that indicate the person was covered by a 
private health insurance plan that included at least some prescription drug insurance coverag e for 
each round of 2020. It should be noted that the information was elicited from a pick-list, code-
all-that-apply, question that asked what type of health insurance a person obtained through an 
establishment. The list included: hospital and physician benefits including coverage through an HMO, Medigap coverage, vision coverage, dental, and prescription drugs. It is possible some prescription drug coverage provided by hospital and physician plans was not independently enumerated in this question. Persons with reported prescription drug coverage from at least one

reported privat
e plan were coded as having private prescription drug coverage. Users should note 
that persons with missing information on prescription drug benefits for all reported private plans 
and those who reported that they did not have prescription drug coverage for one or more plans but had missing information on other plans are coded as not having private prescription drug coverage.  
PMEDIN53 reflects coverage for all of Panel 2 5 Round 3, all  of Panel 24 Round 5, and all of 
Panel 23 Round 7 where the end reference year could extend into 2021. PMEDIN31 for Panel 24 Round 3 reflects coverage in 2019 and 2020 since the Round 3 reference period spans both years. A second version of these prescription drug coverage indicators was built to reflect only current year coverage (PMDINS rr).  
See Appendix 4 for a description of the rounds and variables for the 2020 Panel 23 data. 
Medical Debt Variables (PROBPY42 - PYUNBL42)  
Questions relating to medical debt were asked in the health insurance section. Respondents in Round 2, Round 4, or Round 6 were asked questions HX770 (“In the past 12 months did anyone in the family have problems paying or were unable to pay any medical bills?”), HX780 (“Does anyone in  your family currently have any medical bills that are being paid off over time?”), and 
HX790 ( “Does anyone in your family currently have any medical bills that you are unable to pay at all?”). The corresponding constructed variables PROBPY42, CRFMPY42, and PYUNBL42 are included in this file. PROBPY42 was set to 1 (Yes) if the respondent indicated that someone in their family had problems paying or were unable to pay any medical bills. Additional questions ascertained if anyone in the family currently had medical bills that were being paid off over time (CRFMPY42), and if anyone in the family currently had any medical bills that were unable to be paid at all (PYUNBL42). If the respondent indicated that someone in their family currently has any medical bills  that are being paid off over time, then CRFMPY42 
was set to 1 (Yes). Note that if the respondent indicates that no one in their family had problems paying medical bills, then PYUNBL42 is set to - 1 (Inapplicable).  
Prescription Drug Usual Third Party Payer Variables (PMEDUP31 -PMEDPY53)  
Round- specific variables are provided that indicate whether the sample member had a usual third 
party payer for prescription medications (PMEDUPrr), and if so, what type of payer (PMEDPYrr). These questions were asked only of sample members who reportedly had at least one prescription medication purchase in the round. In each interview, if the sample member reportedly had a third party payer, then the respondent was asked the name of the sample member’s usual third party payer. These responses were coded into the following source of payment categories in PMEDPYrr: Private Insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, VA/CHAMPVA, TRICARE, State/Local Government, and Other. For Panel 23 sample members, the values of PMEDUP31 and PMEDPY31 are the answers to the Round 6 interview questions and have values identical to those of PMEDUP42 and PMEDPY42, respectively. Users should note that these questions were asked in the Prescribed Medicines  (PM) section of the questionnaire, and 
that no attempt was made to reconcile the responses with information collected in the health insurance section of the questionnaire.

2.5.11  Utilization, Expenditures, and Sources of Payment Variables  (TOTTCH 20-
RXOSR20) 
The MEPS Household Component (HC) collects data in each round on use and expenditures for 
office - and hospital-based care, home health care, dental services, vision aids, and prescribed 
medicines. Data were collected for each sample person at the event level (e.g., doctor visit, 
hospital stay) and summed across Rounds 
6 - 7 for Panel 23, Rounds 3 - 5 for Panel 24 
(excluding 2019 events covered in Round 3) and across Rounds 1 - 3 for Panel 25 (excluding 
2021 events covered in Round 3) to produce the annual utilization and expenditure data for 2020. 
In addition, the MEPS Medical Provider Component (MPC) is a follow-b ack survey that 
collected data from a sample of medical providers and pharmacies that were used by sample 
persons in 2020. Expenditure data collected i n the MPC are generally  r egarded as more accurate 
than information co llected  in the HC and were used to improve the overall quality of MEPS 
expenditure data in this file (see below for description of methodology used to develop 
expenditure data). 
This file contains utilization and expenditure variables for several categories of health  care 
services. In general, there is one utilization variable (based on HC responses only), 11 
expenditure variables (derived from both HC and MPC responses), and one charge variable for 
each category of health  car e service. The utilization variable is typically a count of the number of 
medical events reported for the category. The 11 expenditure variables consist of an aggregate 
total payments variable and 10 main component source of payment category variables (see below 
for description of source of paymen t categories). Expenditure variables for all categories of 
health care combined  are also provided. These variables generally represent a full year of use and 
expenditures. However, for persons who were not inscope for the entire 
year, these variables 
reflect only the period of eligibility. 
The table 
in Appendix 3 provides an overview of the utilization and expenditure variables 
included in this file. For each health service category, the table lists the corresponding utilization 
variable(s) and provides a general key to the expenditure variable names (11 p er service 
category). The first three characters of  the expenditure variable names reflect the service category 
(except only two characters for prescription medicines) 
while the subsequent three characters 
(*** in table) reflect the naming convention for the source of payment categories described 
below (except only two characters for Veterans Administration). The last two positions of all 
utilization and expenditure variable names r eflect the survey year (i.e., 20). More details are 
provided on the 
utilization and expenditure  variables in Section 2.5.11 below. 
Expenditures Definition 
Expenditures on this fil e refer to what is paid for health care services. More specifically, 
expenditures 
in MEPS are defined as the sum of direct payments for care provided during the 
year, including out-of-p ocket payments and payments by private insurance, Medicaid, Medicare, 
and other sources. Payments for over-t he-counter drugs are not collected in MEPS. Indirect 
payments not related to specific medical events, such as Medicaid Disproportionate Share and 
Medicare Direct Medical Education subsidies, are also not included. 
The definition of expenditures used in MEPS is somewhat different from the 1987 NMES and 
1977 NMCES surveys where charges rather than sum of payments were used to measure 
C-112 MEPS HC -224 


================================================================================
PÁGINA 121
================================================================================

expenditures. This ch
ange was adopted because charges became a less appropriate proxy for 
medical expenditures during the 1990s due to the increasingly common practice of discounting 
charges. Another change from the two prior surveys is that charges associated with uncollected 
liability, bad debt, and charitable care (unless provided by a public clinic or hospital) are not counted as expenditures because there are no payments associated with those classifications.  
While the concept of expenditures in MEPS has been operationalized as payments for health care services, variables reflecting charges for services received are also provided on the file (see below). Analysts should use caution when wor king with the charge variables because they do not 
typically represent actual dollars exchanged for services or the resource costs of those services.  
Data Sources on Expenditures  
The expenditure data included on this file were derived from the MEPS Household and Medical Provider Components. Only HC data were collected for non-physician visits, dental and vision services, other medical equipment and services, and home health care not provided by an agency. Data on expenditures for care provided by home healt h agencies were only collected in the MPC. 
In addition to HC data, MPC data were collected for a sample of office-based visits to physicians (or medical providers supervised by physicians), hospital-based events (e.g., inpatient stays, emergency room visits, and outpatient department visits), and prescribed medicines. For these types of events, MPC data were used if complete; otherwise, HC data were used if complete. Missing data for events where HC data were not complete and MPC data were not collected or complete were derived through an imputation process (see below). 
A series of logical edits were applied to both the HC and MPC data to correct for several 
problems including, but not limited to, outliers, copayments or charges reported as total payments, and reimbursed amounts that were reported as out-of- pocket payments. In addition, 
edits were implemented to correct for misclassifications between Medicare and Medicaid and between Medicare HMOs and private HMOs as payment sources. Data were not edited to ensure complete consistency between the health insurance and source of payment variables on the file. 
Imputation for Missing Expenditures and Data Adjustments  
Expenditure data were imputed to 1) replace missing data, 2) provide estimates for care delivered 
under capitated reimbursement arrangements, and 3) to adjust household-reported insurance 
payments because respondents were often unaware that their insurer paid a discounted amount to the provider. This section contains a general description of the approa ches used for these three 
situations. A more detailed description of the editing and imputation procedures is provided in the documentation for the MEPS event- level files.  
The predictive mean matching (PMM) imputation method was used to impute missing expenditures. This procedure uses regression models (based on events with completely reported expenditure data) to predict total expenses for each event. Then, for each event with missing payment information, a donor event with the closest predicted payment wi th the same pattern of 
expected payment sources as the event with missing payment was used to impute the missing payment value. 
The general approach that was used to impute missing expenditure data on prescribed medicines 
is described in Section 2.5.11 bel ow. 
 C-113 MEPS HC -224 
 


================================================================================
PÁGINA 122
================================================================================

Payments under capi
tated arrangement and public clinics including VA healthcare are not tied to 
individual episodes of medical care. Therefore, expenditures for medical care covered under 
capitated arrangement or received in such public settings were i mputed. Using a weighted 
sequential hot- deck procedure, events covered under capitated arrangements were imputed using 
donor events covered by a managed care organization but paid on a fee- for-service basis. For 
other events, including public clinic and VA, expenditures were imputed using the PMM method where selected predictor variables were used to predict expenditures and match recipient and donor events. 
An adjustment was also applied to some HC-reported expenditure data because an evaluation of 
matched  HC/MPC data showed that respondents who reported that charges and payments were 
equal were often unaware that insurance payments for the care had been based on a discounted charge. To compensate for this systematic reporting error, a weighted sequential h ot-deck 
imputation procedure was implemented to determine an adjustment factor for HC- reported 
insurance payments when charges and payments were reported to be equal. As for the other imputations, selected predictor variables were used to form groups of donor and recipient events for the imputation process. 
Methodology for Flat Fee Expenditures  
Most of the expenditures for medical care reported by MEPS participants are associated with 
single medical events. However, in some situations one charge covers mult iple contacts between 
a medical provider and patient (e.g., obstetrician services, orthodontia). In these situations (generally called flat or global fees), total payments for the flat or global fee were included if the initial service was provided in 2020. For example, all payments for an orthodontist’s fee that covered multiple visits over three years were included if the initial visit occurred in 20 20. 
However, if a visit in 2020 to an orthodontist was part of a flat fee in which the initial visit occurr ed in 2019, then none of the payments for the flat fee were included.  
The approach used to count expenditures for flat fees may create what appear to be inconsistencies between utilization and expenditure variables. For example, if several visits under a flat fee arrangement occurred in 20 20 but the first visit occurred in 2019, then none of 
the expenditures were included, resulting in low expenditures relative to utilization for that person. Conversely, the flat fee methodology may result in high expenditures for some persons relative to their utilization. For example, all of the expenditures for an expensive flat fee were included even if only the first visit covered by the fee had occurred in 2020. On average, the methodology used for flat fees should re sult in a balance between overestimation and 
underestimation of expenditures in a particular year. 
Zero Expenditures  
There are some medical events reported by respondents where the payments were zero. This 
could occur for several reasons including (1) free care was provided, (2) bad debt was incurred, (3) care was covered under a flat fee arrangement and it was not the initial event of the bundle (see prior section on Methodology for Flat Fee Expenditures), or (4) follow-up visits were provided without a se parate charge (e.g., after a surgical procedure). In summary, these types of 
events have no impact on totals for the person-level expenditure variables contained in this file.

PÁGINA 123
================================================================================

Source of Payment Categories  
In addition to total expenditures, variables are provided that itemize expenditures according to 
the major source of payment categories. These categories are:  
1. Out of pocket by patient or patient’s family (SLF) --includes any deductible, 
coinsurance, and copayment amounts not covered by other sources, as w ell as 
payments for services and providers not covered by the person’s insurance or other sources;  
2. Medicare (MCR);  
3. Medicaid (MCD);  
4. Private Insurance (PRV);  
5. Veterans’ Administration/CHAMPVA, excluding TRICARE (VA);  
6. TRICARE (TRI);  
7. Other Federal Sources --includes Indian Health Service, military treatment facilities, 
and other care provided by the federal government (OFD);  
8. Other State and Local Sources --includes community and neighborhood clinics, state 
and local health departments, and state programs other than Medicaid (STL);  
9. Worker’s Compensation (WCP);  
10. Other Unclassified Sources --includes sources such as automobile, homeowner’s, 
liability, and other miscellaneous or unknown sources (OSR).  
Prior to 2019, for cases where reported insurance coverage and sources of payment appear  
inconsistent, the positive amount from a source inconsistent with reported insurance coverage was moved to one or both of the source categories Other Private and Other Public. Beginning in 2019, this step is removed and the apparent  inconsistency between the payment sources and 
insurance coverage is allowed to remain - the amounts are not moved to Other Private and Other Public categories any more. The two source of payment categories, Other Private and Other Public, are no longer available.  Some inconsistencies arise from either misreporting of health 
insurance coverage or sources of payment. However, apparent inconsistencies may also have logical explanations. For example, private insurance coverage in MEPS is defined as having a 
major medical plan covering hospital and physician services. If a MEPS sample person did not have such coverage but had a single service type insurance plan (e.g., dental insurance) that paid for a particular episode of care, those payments may be class ified as “other private.” Some of the 
“other public” payments may stem from confusion between Medicaid and other state and local programs or may be for persons who were not enrolled in Medicaid, but were presumed eligible by a provider who ultimately recei ved payments from the program. 
The naming conventions used for the source of payment expenditure variables are shown in parentheses in the list of categories above and in the key to the attached table in Appendix 3. In 
 C-115 MEPS HC -224 
 


================================================================================

addition, total expenditure
 variables (EXP in key) based on the sum of the 10 source of payment 
variables above are provided. 
Charge Variables 
In addition to the expenditure variables described above, a variable reflecting total charges is 
provided for each type of service category (except prescribed medicines). This variable represents the sum of all fully established charges for care received and usually does not reflect actual payments made for services, which can be substantially lower due to factors such as negotiated discounts, bad debt, and free care (see above). The weighted sequential hot -deck 
procedure was used to impute the missing total charges. The naming convention used for the charge variables (TCH) is also included in the key to the attached table in Appendix 3. The total charge variable across services (TOTTCH 20) excludes prescribed medicines.  
Utilization and Expenditure Variables by Type of Medical Service  
The following sections summarize definitional, conceptual, and analytic considerations when using the utilization and expenditure variables in this file. Separate discussions are provided for each MEPS medical service category. There is also a discussion in the section dealing with analyses of trends using MEPS data (S ection 3.12).  
Medical Provider Visits (i.e., Office -Based Visits)  
Medical provider visits consist of encounters that took place primarily in office- based settings 
and clinics. Care provided in other settings such as a hospital, nursing home, or a person’s home are not included in this category.  
The total number of office -based visits reported for 2020 (OBTOTV 20) as well as the number of 
such visits to physicians (OBDRV20 ) are contained in this file.  
Expenditure variables associated with all medical provider visits and physician visits can be 
identified using the attached table in Appendix 3.  
Hospital Events  
Separate utilization variables for hospital care are provided for each type of setting (outpatient 
department, emergency room, and inpatient stays) along with three expense variables per setting: one for basic hospital facility expenses, one for payments to physicians who billed separately for services provided at the hospital (referred to as “separately billing doctor” or SBD expenses) and one that aggregates the facility and SBD expenses (aggregated variable not included in files prior to 2007). 
Hospital facility expenses include all expenses for direct hospital care, including room and 
board, diagnostic and laboratory work, x- rays, and similar charges, as well as any physician 
services included in the hospital charge. SBD expenses typically cover services provided to patients in hospital settings by providers like radiologists, anesthesiologists, and pathologists, whose charges are often not included in hospital bills.

Hospital Outpatient Visits  
Variabl es for the total number of reported visits to hospital outpatient departments in 2020 
(OPTOTV20) as well as the number of outpatient departme nt visits to physicians (OPDRV 20) 
are contained in this file.  
Expenditure variables (both facility and SBD) associ ated with all medical provider visits and 
physician visits can be identified using the attached table in Appendix 3. 
Hospital Emergency Room Visits  
The variable ERTOT 20 represents a count of all emergency room visits reported for the survey 
year. Expenditure variables associated with ERTOT 20 are identified in the attached table in 
Appendix 3. It should be noted that for emergency room visits that immediately preceded an 
inpatient stay, the facility expenditures associated with the emergency room visits are included in the inpatient expenditures. To avoid double counting, these emergency room visits resulted in $0 facility expenditures (but there still may be associated SBD expenses). However, these $0 emergency room visits are still counted as separate visits in the utilization variable ERTOT 20. 
Hospital Inpatient Stays  
Two measures of total inpatient utilization are provided on the file:  
• IPDIS 20 is the total number of hospital discharges. 
• IPNGTD20 is the total number of nights associated with these dischar ges. Please 
note that the variable IPNGTD 20 is an imputed version of the IPNGT20 variable 
released earlier on HC -219. For the FY 2020 data, the number of imputed length of 
stay cases i s 9.  
Expenditure variables associated with hospital inpatient stays are  identified in the attached table 
in Appendix 3. As described in the previous section, payments associated with emergency room 
visits that immediately preceded an inpatient stay are included with the inpatient expenditures. In addition, payments associated with healthy newborns are included with expenditures for the mother. Specifically, data used to construct the inpatient utilization and expenditure variables for newborns were edited to exclude stays where the newborn left the hospital on the same day as the mother. This edit was applied because discharges for infants without complications after birth were not consistently reported in the survey, and charges for newborns without complications are typically included in the mother’s hospital bill. However, i f the newborn was discharged at a 
later date than the mother was discharged, then the discharge was considered a separate stay for the newborn when constructing the utilization and expenditure variables. 
Telehealth Events  
Starting Panel 23 Round 7, Panel 24 Round 5, and Panel 25 Round 3, a new telehealth (TH) 
event type and section were added in CAPI. The TH module is asked of all events tagged as TH events by the respondent. As part of the TH module, a question is asked about whether the provider or facility is owned or operated by a hospital. Post-collection, the response to this question is used to reclassify all TH events as either OB or OP. The TH module items were designed to align with the existing OB and OP items to easily allow for reclassifying the  event 
type.

Dental Care Visits  
The total num
ber of dent al care visits variable (DVTOT 20) includes those to any person(s) for 
dental care including general dentists, dental hygienists, dental technicians, dental surgeons, 
orthodontists, endodontists, and periodontists.  
Home Health Care  
In contrast to other types of medical events where data were collected on a per visit basis, 
information on home health care utilization is collected in MEPS on a per month basis. Variables are provided that indicate the total number of days in 2020 where home health care was received from the following: from any type of paid or unpaid caregiver (HHTOTD 20), from agencies, 
hospitals, or nursing homes (HHAGD20), from  self-employed persons (HHINDD20), and from 
unpaid informal caregivers not living with the sample person (HHINFD20). The number of provider days represents the sum across months of the number of days on which home health care was received, with days summed across all providers seen. For example, if a person received care in one month from one provider on two different days, then the number of provider days would equal two. The number of provider days would also equal two if a person received care from two different providers on the same day. However, if a person received care from one provider two times on the same day, then the provider days would equal one. These variables were assigned missing values if the number of provider days could not be computed for any month in which the specific type of home health care was  received.  
Separate expenditure variables are provided for agency -sponsored home health care (includes 
care provided by home health agencies, hospitals, and nursing homes) and care provided by self-employed persons. The attached table in Appendix 3 identifies the home health care utilization and expenditure variables contained in the file. 
Other Medical Equipment and Services  
The new CAPI instrument collects round- specific Other Medical (OM) expenditures for all OM 
types (glasses/contact lenses, ambulance, disposable supplies, and long- term equipment). Please 
note for disposable supplies, the total charge and out-of- pocket expenditures are collected in a 
range format. The ranges were replaced with mean dollar amounts of respective expenditures 
reported in ea ch range in prior years.  
Prescribed Medicines  
There is one tot al utilization variable (RXTOT 20) and 11 expenditure variables included on the 
2020 full -year file relating to prescribed medicines. These 11 expenditure variables include an 
annual total expenditure variable (RXEXP 20) and 10 corresponding annual source of payment 
variables (RXSLF 20, RXMCR20, RXMCD 20, RXPRV 20, RXVA20, RXTRI 20, RXOFD 20, 
RXSTL 20, RXWCP 20, and RXOSR 20). The total utilization variable is a count of all fills and 
refills of prescribed  medications obtained during 2020. The total expenditure variable sums all 
amounts paid out-of-pocket and by third party payers for each prescription obtained in 2020. No variables reflecting charges for prescription medicines are included because a large proportion of respondents to the MEPS pharmacy component survey did not provide charge data (see below). 
Prescribed Medicines Data Collected  
Data regarding prescription drugs were obtained through the household questionnaire and a 
pharmacy component survey. During each round of the MEPS HC, all respondents were asked to

PÁGINA 127
================================================================================

supply the name of any
 prescribed medication they or their family members purchased or 
otherwise obtained during that round. For each medication and in each round, the following 
information was collected: the number of times the prescription drug was obtained or purchased, and a list of the names, addresses, and types of pharmacies that filled the household’s prescriptions. In the round each medication was first reported, the following inform ation was 
collected: the name(s) of any health conditions the medication was prescribed for, and the year and month which the person first used the medication. Payment information was collected in the pharmacy component survey.  
Pharmacy providers identified by the household were contacted by telephone in the pharmacy 
component if permission to release their pharmacy records was obtained in writing from the person with the prescription. The signed permission forms were provided to the various establishments  prior to making any requests for information. Each establishment was informed 
of all persons participating in the survey that had pr escriptions filled there in 20 20 and a 
computerized printout containing information about these prescriptions was sought. F or each 
medication listed, the following information was requested: national drug code (NDC), medication name, strength of medicine (amount and unit), quantity (package size and amount dispensed), and payments by source. 
Information about diabetic supplies and equipment, such as syringes and test strips, were 
reported in the prescription drug section of MEPS and use of and expenditures for these items are included in the person- level prescribed medicine variables.  
Prescri bed Medicines Data Editing and Imputation  
The general approach to preparing the household prescription data for this file was to utilize the pharmacy component prescription data to assign expenditure values to the household drug mentions. For those with Pharmacy Component data, a matching program was adopted to link pharmacy component drugs and the corresponding drug information to household drug mentions. To improve the quality of these matches, all drugs on the household and pharmacy files were coded based on the medication names provided by the household and pharmacy, and when available, the national drug code (NDC) provided in the pharmacy survey. Considerable editing was done prior to the matching to correct data inconsistencies in both data sets, fill in missing data, and correct outliers on the pharmacy file. 
Drug price per unit outliers were analyzed on the pharmacy file by first identifying the national 
average drug acquisition cost (NADAC) per unit, wholesale acquisition unit cost (WAUC), and averag e wholesale unit price (AWUP) of the drug by linkage through the NDC to secondary  
databases. In general, prescription drug unit prices were deemed to be outliers by comparing unit prices reported in the pharmacy database to the NADAC per unit  and were edited, as necessary. 
Prior to 2020, AWUP was the benchmark used to identify outlier prices for prescription medications in the PC.  Beginning with the 2007 data, the rules used to identify outlier prices 
relative to the AWUP  changed. New outlier thresholds were established based on the distribution 
of the ratio of retail unit prices relative to the AWUP in the 2006 MarketScan Outpatient Pharmaceutical Claims database.  
Starting with the 2008 Prescribed Medicine file, improvements in the data editing changed the distribution of payments by source: (1) more spending on Medicare beneficiaries is by private 
 C-119 MEPS HC -224 
 


================================================================================
PÁGINA 128
================================================================================

insurance, rather than Medicare, and (2) there are less out -of-pocket payments and more 
Medicaid payments among Medicaid enrollees. Beginning with the 2009 data, another change 
affected the data for Medicare beneficiaries with both Part D and Medicaid coverage: reported Medicaid and other state and local program payments were no longer edited to be Medicare payments. Beginning with the 2017 data, changes in the price imputation procedures for specialty drugs with missing payment information resulted in higher total prescribed medicines expenditures.  
Beginning with the 2020 data, the rules used to identify outlier prices for prescription 
medications in the PC were improved based on newer price benchmarks and analyses (Ding and Hill 2022). New outlier thresholds were established based on the distribution of the ratio of retail unit prices relative to the NADAC per unit, collected for the Centers for Medicare and Medi caid 
Services. When the NADAC per unit is not available, then the WAUC is used, and if neither are available, the AWUP is used. AWUP and WAUC are list prices, not averages, so the NADAC per unit better reflects the prices paid for drugs, and as a result the prices paid for generics are lower in the 2020 data, compared with the 2019 data, and fewer generic fills have third party payments. 
For Round 3, which spans two years, drug mentions in that round were allocated between the 
years based on the following information: the number of times the respondent said the drug was purchased in the respective year, the year the person started taking the drug, the length of the person’s round, the dates of the person’s round, and the number of fills of that drug for that person in the round.  
Collapsed Source of Payment Variables  
Two additional source of payment variables are included for each health care service category as 
a convenience to data users since they are common analytic groupings of the payment sources. The first (***PTR 20 series) is the sum of the private and Tricare payer categories (i.e., 
***PTR20=***PRV20+***TRI20). The second (***OTH20 series) is the sum of the least common source of payment categories including: 1) other federal (***OFD20), 2) state and  local 
(***STL20), and 3) other sources (***OSR20). Since the ***PTR20 and ***OTH20 variable 
series represent combined totals of existing individual source of payment variables, analysts should exercise caution to avoid inappropriate double counting of expenditures when working with these variables.

.6.3 Lo ngitudinal Analysis  
Panel -specific longitudinal files are available for do wnloading in the data section of the MEPS 
website. As has been done routinely in past years , the longitudinal file for Panel 24 comprises 
MEPS survey data obtained in Rounds 1 through 5 of the panel and can be used to analyze changes over a two -year period . Unlike past years for MEPS, in 2020 Panel 23 had data collected 
for a third year. As such, two-year and three-year longitudinal files will be developed for Panel 23. These can be used to analyze changes over the corresponding two -year or three -year perio d. 
Variables in the file pertaining to survey administration, demographics, employment, health status, disability days, quality of care, patient satisfaction, health insurance, and medical care use and expenditures were obtained from the MEPS full- year Con solidated files from the years

3.0 Survey Sample Information  
3.1 Discussion of Pandemic E ffect s on Quality of  2020 MEPS Data  
3.1.1  Summary  
Data collection for in -person sample surveys in 2020 presented real challenges after the onset of 
the COVID -19 pandemic at a national level in mid -March of that year. After major modifications 
to the standard MEPS study design, it was possible to collect data safely, but there were naturally 
concerns about the quality of the data after such modifications. Some issues related to data quality were identified and are discussed below. As with most in-person surveys conducted in 2020, researchers are counseled to take care in the interpretation of 2020 estimates including the comparison of such estimates with those of other years.  
3.1.2  Overview  
The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 had a major impact on the MEPS Household Component (MEPS- HC) as it did for most major federal surveys and, of course, American life 
generally. The following discussion describes 1) the general impact of the pandemic on three major federal surveys (the effects on two of which also affect MEPS); 2) modifications to the MEPS sample design and field operations in 2020 due to the pandemic; and 3) potential data quality issues in the FY 2020 MEPS data related to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
3.1.3  The Impact of the Pandemic on some Major Federal Surveys  
Many important federal surveys were collecting data when much of the nation shut down in the face of the pandemic in March 2020. Among them were the Current Population Survey (CPS), the American Community Survey (ACS), and the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). The ACS and the NHIS field new samples each year. The CPS includes rotating panels, meaning some of the sampled households fielded had participated in prior years while others were fresh. Two of these surveys have important roles in MEPS. Estimates of CPS subgroups serve as benchmark s for the MEPS weighting process (referred to below as “raking control totals”) while 
households fielded for Round 1 of MEPS in each year are selected as a subsample of the NHIS responding households from the prior year. 
Because data collection in 2020 occurred under such unusual circumstances, all three of these 
surveys have reported bias concerns. (In fact, the ACS decided not to release a standard database for 2020 due to the uncertain quality of the data, while the CPS and the NHIS released data but included reports discussing concerns about bias.) All three surveys have reported evidence of nonresponse bias, specifically, that households in higher socio- economic levels were relatively 
more likely to respond and the sample weighting was unable to fully compensate for this. As a result, analysts have been cautioned about the accuracy of survey estimates and the ability to compare resulting estimates with estimates obtained in the years prior to the pandemic .

================================================================================
PÁGINA 134
================================================================================

The quality of
 CPS data is of particular importa nce to Full Year 2020 MEPS PUFs as CPS 
estimates serve as the control totals for the raking component of the MEPS weighting process. 
These control totals are based on the following demographic variables: age, sex, race/ethnicity, region, MSA status, educational attainment, and poverty status. The CPS estimates used in the development of the FY 2020 MEPS PUF weights that were based on the variables age, sex, race/ethnicity, region, and MSA status were evaluated by the Census Bureau and determined to be of high quality. However, similar evaluations of the corresponding CPS estimates associated with educational attainment and poverty status found that these estimates suffered from bias.  
A set of references discussing the fielding of these three surveys during the pandemic and 
resulting bias concerns can be found in the References section of this document. 
3.1.4  Modifications to the MEPS -HC 2020 Sample Design and Implementation Effort 
in Response to the Pandemic  
For the MEPS- HC, face- to-face interviewing ceased due to the COVID-19 pandemic on March 
17, 2020. At that time, there were two MEPS panels in the field for which 2020 data were being collected: Round 1 of Panel 25 and Round 3 of Panel 24. The sampled households for Panel 25 were being contacted and asked to participate in MEPS for the fi rst time while those from 
Panel  24 had already participated in MEPS for two rounds. A third MEPS panel was also in the 
field in early 2020, Round 5 of Panel 23, collecting data for the last portion of 2019.  
In developing a plan for how best to resume MEPS data collection, the primary issues were how 
to do so safely for both sampled household members and interviewers and the potential impact on data quality. Telephone data collection, although not the preferred method of dat a collection 
in general for MEPS -HC, was the natural option because it did not require in-person contact with 
respondents and could be implemented relatively quickly. The impact of changing to telephone on both response rates and data quality was expected to be larger for Panel 25 Round 1 (e.g., no experience with reporting health care events in the recent past) . At the time in -person 
interviewing stopped in mid -March 2020 completion rates for Panels 23 and 24 were 
substantially higher than those for Panel 25.  
AHRQ decided to field Panel 23 for at least one more year, asking Panel 23 respondents if they 
would be open to further participation in MEPS in newly added Rounds 6 and 7. Extending 
Panel 23 was meant to both offset the decrease in the number of cases in the FY 2020 data related to lower expected sample yields for Panel 25 and to improve data quality by retaining a set of participants who were familiar with MEPS. These decisions required major changes in survey operations, including adding a fall Panel 23 Round 6 interview covering all 2020 events from January 1, 2020 to the date of the interview.  
3.1.5  Data Quality Issues for MEPS for FY 2020  
Numerous analyses were conducted to examine potential impacts on data quality and to gain a more complete understanding of these issues. Zuvekas and Kashihara (2021) discuss some of these analyses and provide additional background information on how the MEPS study design was modified in 2020 in response to the pandemic. Three sources of potential bias that were

================================================================================
PÁGINA 135
================================================================================

identified are
 noted here: the long recall period for Round 6 of Panel 23; switching from in-
person to telephone interviewing which likely had a larger impact on Panel 25; and the impact of 
CPS bias on the MEPS weights. Each is considered in turn.  
Comparisons of health care utilization data for Panel 24 and Panel 23 indicated that the extended 
reference period for Panel 23 Round 6 may have resulted in recall issues for respondents. Round 6 was initially fielded in the late summer and early fall of 2020, and because the Round 5 reference period ended on December 31, 2019, the recall period for health care events and related information extended back to January 1, 2020, much longer than for typical MEPS rounds. For Panel 23 Round 6 respondents, events of a less salient nature, such as dental visits and office-based physician visits, occurring in early 2020 were under-reported. Underreporting was confirmed through both an examination of differential utilization across 2020 for Panel 23 respondents as well as statistical comparisons of Panel 23 and Panel 24 event estimates. Adjustments were made to the sample weights for Panel 23 to help address this concern. Details on these adjustments can be found in Section 3.3.1.  
Comparisons of Panel 25 with Panel 24 health care utilization data found that the difference in 
estimates reached statistical significance for several event types with those from Panel 25 generally being the higher. The same comparisons between first and second year panels in MEPS in recent years sho wed relatively few such differences with no differences at all in 2019.  
Finally, AHRQ decided to calibrate, via raking, the FY 2020 Consolidated PUF weights to control totals reflecting CPS 2021 poverty status data. As discussed earlier, bias was identifi ed 
by the Census Bureau in the 2020 and 2021 CPS income data and correlates. Nevertheless, the Census Bureau decided to use its standard sample weighting approach for both the 2020 and 2021 CPS ASEC data sets while recognizing some deficiencies in the nonresponse adjustment approach for the two years as a result of data collection during the pandemic. Similarly, MEPS has used poverty status based on the CPS estimates for calibration for many years and continued to do so for the 2020 Full Year Consolidated PUF as it was decided that the advantages of doing so outweighed the disadvantages.  
3.1.6  Discussion and Guidance  
The additional procedures for developing person- level and family -level final weights for the 
2020 Consolidated MEPS data were designed to correct for potential biases in the data due to changes in data collection and response bias. However, evaluations of MEPS data quality in 2020 - corroborated in analyses of other Federal surveys fielded in 2020 - suggest that users of the MEPS FY 2020 Consolidated PUF should exercise caution when interpreting estimates and assessing analyses based on these data as well as in comparing 2020 estimates to those of prior years.  
3.2 Background on Sample Design and Response Rates  
The MEPS is designed to produce estimates at the national and regional level over time for the civilian, noninstitutionalized population of the United States and some subpopulations of

interest. The da
ta in this public use file pertain to calendar year 2020. The data were collected in 
Rounds 1, 2, and 3 for MEPS Panel 25, Rounds 3, 4, and 5 for MEPS Panel 24, and Rounds 6 
and 7 for MEPS Panel 23.  
As usual, Round 3 for a MEPS panel (this time for Panel 25) has been  designed to overlap two 
calendar years, as illustrated below.  However it may be noted that, with the fielding of a third 
panel in 2020 (as indicated in the data quality discussion in Section 3.1), the structure of other 
rounds has changed. Round 7 of Panel 23 and Round 5 of Panel 24 serve the same purpose as Round 3 of Panel 25. Thus, Round 7 was fielded in 2021 and designed to collect data for the remainder of 2020 as well as the period of time from January 1, 2021 up through the date of the Round 7 interview. Round 5 of Panel 24 was designed for the same purpose, collecting data associated with both 2020 and 2021. This was done to permit all three of these panels to provide data for the F Y 2021 MEPS data sets as well as those for FY 2020.  
One other change of note is that, for 2020 Panel 23 Round 6 represents the reference period from the date of the Round 6 interview back to January 1, 2020 (as discussed in the data quality subsection). 
Variables c
onvey the same information for this full year consolidated file that has been provided 
for the full year consolidated files associated with years 1996 - 2019 of MEPS.  
A sample design feature shared by Panel 23, Panel 24, and Panel 25 involved the partitioning of the sample domain “Other” (serving as the catchall stratum and consisting mainly of households with “White” members) into two sample domains. This was done for the first time in Panel 16. The two domains distinguished between those house holds characterized as “complete” 
respondents to the NHIS and those characterized as “partial completes.” NHIS “partial completes” typically have a lower response rate to MEPS and for all three  MEPS panels the 
“partial” domain was sampled at a lower rate t han the “complete” domain. This approach has 
served to reduce survey costs, since the “partials” tend to have higher costs in gaining survey participation, but has also increased sample variability due to the resulting increased variability

================================================================================
PÁGINA 137
================================================================================

in sampling rates.  
Starting with Panel 25, the “Other, Partial” domain includes the NHIS 
households that have provided only a roster of household members. For detailed information on 
the MEPS sample design, see Chowdhury et al (2019). 
3.2.1 MEPS -Linked to the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)  
Each responding household found in this 2020 MEPS dataset is associated with one of the three separate and overlapping MEPS panels, Panel 23, Panel 24, and Panel 25. These panels consist of subsamples of households participating in the 2017, 2018, and 2019 NHIS, respectively. The Full Year 2018 PUF wa s the first one where both MEPS panels reflect the new NHIS sample 
design first implemented in 2016. 
Whenever there is a change in sample or study design, it is good survey practi ce to assess 
whether such a change could affect the sample estimates. For example, increased coverage of the 
target populations with an updated sample design based on data from the latest Census can improve the accuracy of the sample estimates. MEPS estima tes have been and will continue to be 
evaluated to determine if an important change in the survey estimates might be associated with a change in design. Discussion on the potential effects of MEPS design changes in 2020 appears Section 3.1. Background on the two NHIS sample designs of interest is provided next. 
Background on the NHIS Sample Redesign Implemented in 2016  
Beginning in 2016, NCHS implemented another new sample design for the NHIS, which differed substantially from the prior design. Each of the 50 states as well as the District of Columbia served as explicit strata for sample selection purposes with the intent of providing the capability of state -level NHIS estimates obtained through pooling across years if the sample size 
for a single year would  result in unreliable estimates. In contrast to the previous design, 
households in areas with relatively high concentrations of minorities are not oversampled. PSUs are still formed at the county level. However, within sampled PSUs, the clusters of address es that 
have been sampled for each year of the NHIS are not in the form of segments (consisting of one or more census blocks) as was done for the previous NHIS designs. For the 2016 NHIS, each such cluster consisted of roughly 25 subclusters selected using random systematic sampling 
across the full geography of the PSU. Each subcluster is made up of, generally, four nearby 
addresses, or roughly 100 addresses in all. The number of subclusters per cluster can vary from 
year to year.  
Another major change is t hat the list of DUs (addresses) was obtained from the Computerized 
Delivery Sequence File (CDSF) of the U.S. Postal Service, which is a different approach than the standard listing process for area probability samples used in the pre-2016 designs. While addresses in the CDSF provide very high coverage of most areas of the country, coverage in 
rural areas can be somewhat lower. For rural areas where this was a concern, address lists were created through the conventional listing process. A description of the NHIS sample design
 
is 
found on the NHIS website.

Panel 23 Household Sample Size  
A subsample of 9,700 households (occupied DUs) selected for MEPS Panel 23 from NHIS 
responding households in 2017, of which 9,694 were fielded for MEPS after the elimination of any units characterized as ineligible for fielding.  
Panel 24 Household Sample Size  
A subsample of 9,700 households was randomly selected for MEPS Panel 24 from the households responding to the 2018 NHIS, of which 9,684 were fielded for MEPS after the elimination of any units characterized as ineligible for fielding.  
Panel 25 Household Sample Size  
A subsample of 9,900 households was randomly selected for MEPS Panel 25 from the households responding to the 2019 NHIS, of which 9,888 were fielded for MEPS after the elimination of any units characterized as ineligible for fielding.  
Implications of the New Design on MEPS Estimates  
Under the new design, MEPS sampled households reflec t the clustering of the NHIS, as 
described above but to a somewhat lesser degree due to the sampling from NHIS respondents . 
Due to the spreading of the NHIS sample in small subclusters across the PSU and the sampling limited to only NHIS respondents, the i mpact of clustering on the variance of MEPS estimates 
may be more limited. Also, in contrast to the previous design, the NHIS sampling rates at the address level currently do not vary due to oversampling of minorities (although this could change in subsequent years). On balance, the overall variation in sampling rates/weights at the national level for the NHIS is expected to be lower with a corresponding positive impact on the precision of MEPS estimates. However, with a reduction in the sample sizes of min ority households, 
precision levels of MEPS estimates for Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians may be reduced to some extent.  
3.2.2  Sample Weights and Variance Estimation  
In the dataset “MEPS HC -224: 2020 Full Year Consolidated Data File,” weight variables are 
provided for generating MEPS estimates of totals, means, percentages, and rates for persons and families in the civilian noninstitutionalized population. The person- level weight variable 
PERWT20F provided in this file supersedes the corresponding person- level weight variable 
provided in the 2020 Full Year Population Characteristic File (HC -219). Procedures and 
considerations associated with the construction and interpretation of person and family- level  
estimates using these and other variables are discussed below.

3.3 The MEPS Sampling Process and Response Rates: An Overview  
For most MEPS panels, a sample representing about three-eighths of the NHIS responding 
households is made available for use in MEP S. This was the case for MEPS Panel 23, Panel 24, 
and Panel 25. 
Because the MEPS subsampling has to be done soon after NHIS responding households are 
identified, a small percentage of the NHIS households initially characterized as NHIS respondents are later classified as nonrespondents for the purposes of NHIS data analysis. This actually serves to increase the overall MEPS response rate slightly since the percentage of NHIS households designated for use in MEPS (all those characterized initially as respondents from the NHIS panels and quarters used by MEPS for a given year) is slightly larger than the final NHIS household-level response rate and some NHIS nonresponding households do participate in MEPS. However, as a result, these NHIS nonrespondents who are MEPS participants have no NHIS data available to link with MEPS data. Once the MEPS sample is selected from among the NHIS households, characterized as NHIS respondents, RUs  consisting entirely of military 
personnel are deleted from the sample. Military personnel not living in the same RU as civilians are ineligible for MEPS. After  these exclu sions, all RUs associated with households, selected 
from among those identified as NHIS responding households are then fielded in the first round of MEPS.  
Table 3.1 shows in Rows A, B, and C the three informational components just discussed. Row A indicates the percentage of NHIS households eligible for MEPS. Row B indicates the number of NHIS households sampled for MEPS. Row C indicates the number of sampled households actually fielded for MEPS (after dropping the students and military members discussed above and a small number of NHIS households sampled in error ). Note that all response rates discussed 
here are unweighted.

3.3.1  Response Rates  
In order to produ ce annual health care estimates for calendar year 2020 based on the full MEPS 
sample data from the MEPS Panel 23, Panel 24, and Panel 25, the three panels are combined. 
More specifically, full calendar year 2020 data collected in Rounds 6 and 7 for the MEP S 
Panel  23 and Rounds 3 through 5 for the MEPS Panel 24 sample are pooled with data from the 
first three rounds of data collection for the MEPS Panel 25 sample (the general approach is described below).  
As mentioned above, all response rates discussed here are unweighted. To understand the 
calculation of MEPS response rates, some features related to MEPS data collection should be noted. When an RU is visited for a round of data collection, changes in RU membership are identified. Such changes include the formation of student RUs as well as other new RUs created when RU members from a previous round have moved to another location in the U.S. Thus, the number of RUs eligible for MEPS interviewing in a given round is determined after data collection is fully c ompleted. The ratio of the number of RUs completing the MEPS interview in 
a given round to the number of RUs characterized as eligible to complete the interview for that round represents the “conditional” response rate for that round expressed as a proportion. It is “conditional” in that it pertains to the set of RUs characterized as eligible for MEPS for that round and thus is “conditioned” on prior participation rather than representing the overall response rate through that round. For example, in Table 3.1, for Panel 25 Round 2 the ratio of 4,677 (Row G) to 5,958 (Row F) multiplied by 100 represents the response rate for the round (78.5 percent when computed), conditioned on the set of RUs characterized as eligible for MEPS for that round. Taking the product of the percentage of the NHI S sample eligible for MEPS 
(Row  A) with the product of the ratios for a consecutive set of MEPS rounds beginning with 
Round 1 produces the overall response rate through the last MEPS round specified. 
The overall unweight ed response rate for 2020 for the combined sample after pooling the 
respondents across the three panels was obtained by computing the product of the compositing 
factor associated with each panel (discussed in Section 3.4.6 describing the development of the final weight for the FY 2020 Consolidated PUF) and the corresponding overall panel response rate and then summing the three products. Panel 25  represents about 34.6 percent of the 
combined sample size, Panel 24 represents about 35.9 percent  and Panel 23 r epresents the 
remaining 29.4 percent. Thus, the combined response rate of 27.6 percent was computed as 0. 29 
times 28.0 (28.0 is the overall Panel 23 response rate through Round 7) plus 0.36 times 28.8 (28.8 is the overall Panel 24 response rate through Round 5) plus 0.35 times 25.9 (25.9 is the 
overall Panel 25 response rate through Round 3.) 
The overall response rate of 27.6 percent for 2020 is substantially lower than that for 2019 (39.5 
percent), reflecting the impact of the pandemic on data collection efforts.  
3.3.2  Panel 25 Response Rates  
9,888 households for MEPS Panel 25, Round 1 were fielded in 2020 (Row C of Table 3.1), a randomly selected subsample of the households responding to the 2019 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS).

Table 3.1 shows t
he number of RUs eligible for interviewing in each Round of Panel 25 as well 
as the number of RUs completing the MEPS interview. Computing the individual round 
“conditional” response rates as described in S ection 3.3.1 and then taking the product of these 
three response rates and the factor 65.7 (the percentage of the NHIS sampled households designated for use in selecting a sample of households for MEPS) yields an overall response rate of 25.9 percent for Panel 25 through Round 3. 
3.3.3  Panel 24 Response Rates  
9,684 households for MEPS Panel 24, were fielded in 2019 (as indicated in Row C of Table 3.1), a randomly selected subsample of the households responding to the 2018 National Health 
Interview Survey (NHIS).  
Table 3.1 shows the number of RUs eligible for interviewing and the number completing the 
interview for all five rounds of Panel 24. The overall response rate for Panel 24 was computed in a similar fashion to that of Panel 25 but covering all five rounds of MEPS interviewing as well as the factor representing the percentage of NHIS sampled households eligible for MEPS. The overall response rate for Panel 24 through Round 5 is 28.8 percent .  
3.3.4 Panel 23 Response Rates  
9,694 households for MEPS Panel 23 we re fielded in 2018 (as indicated in Row C of Table 3.1), 
a randomly selected subsample of the households responding to the 2017 National Health 
Interview Survey (NHIS).  
Table 3.1 shows the number of RUs eligible for interviewing and the number completing the 
interview for all seven  rounds of Panel 23. The overall response rate for Panel 23 was computed 
in a similar fashion to that of Panel 24 but covering all seven  rounds of MEPS interviewing as 
well the factor representing the percentage of NHIS sampled households eligible for MEPS. The overall response rate for Panel 23 through Round 7 is 28.0 percent.  
3.3.5  Annual (Combined Panel) Response Rate  
A combined panel response rate for the survey respondents in this data set is obtained by taking a weighted average of the panel -specific response rates. The Panel 23 response rate was weighted 
by a factor of 0.29, the Panel 24 response rate was weighted by a factor of 0. 36 and Panel 25 was 
weighted by a factor of 0. 35, reflecting approximately the distribution of the overall sample 
between the three panels. The resulting combined response rate for the combined panels was computed as (0.29 x 28.0) plus (0. 36 x 28.8) plus (0.35 x 25.9) or 27.6 percent (as shown in 
Table 3.1).

3.3.6  Oversampling  
Oversampling is a feature of the MEPS sample design, helping to increase the precision of 
estimates for some subgroups of interest. Before going into details related to MEPS, the conc ept 
of oversampling will be discussed. 
In a sample where all persons in a population are selected with the same probability and survey 
coverage of the population is high, the sample distribution is expected to be proportionate to the population distribution. For example, if Hispanics represent 15 percent of the general population, one would expect roughly 15 percent of the persons sampled to be Hispanic. However, in order to improve the precision of estimates for specific subgroups of a population, one might decide to select samples from those subgroups at higher rates than the remainder of the population. Thus, one might select Hispanics at twice the rate (i.e., at double the probability) of persons not oversampled. As a result, an oversampled subgroup comprises a higher proportion of the sample than it represents in the general population. Sample weights ensure that population estimates are not distorted by a disproportionate contribution from oversampled subgroups. Base sample weights for oversampled groups will be smaller than for the portion of the population not oversampled. For example, if a subgroup is sampled at roughly twice the rate of sample selection for the remainder of the population not oversampled, members of the oversampled subgroup will receive base or initial sample weights (prior to nonresponse or poststratification adjustments) that are roughly half the size of the group not oversampled.  
As mentioned above, oversampling is implemented to increase the sample sizes and thus 
improve the precision of survey estimates for particular subgroups of the population. The “cost” of oversampling is that the precision of estimates for the general population and subgroups not oversampled will be reduced to some extent compared to the precision one could have achieved if the same overall sample size were selected without any oversampling.  
The NHIS no longer oversamples households with members who are Asian, Black, or Hispanic. Nevertheless, these minority groups are still of analytic interest for MEPS. As a result for all 
three panel s, all households in the Asian, Hispanic, and Black domains were sampled with 
certainty (i.e., all households assigned to those domains were included in the MEPS). In addition, all households in Panel 23 who had a member who was a veteran were also selected with certainty. Among all remaining households for Panel 23, the “Other, complete” domain was sampled at a rate of about 69 percent while the “Other, partial complete” domain was sampled at a rate of ab out 43 percent. For Panel 24, the corresponding sampling rates for the “Other, 
complete” domain and the “Other, partial complete” domain were about 79 percent and 50 percent, respectively. For Panel 25, the corresponding sampling rates for the “Other, complete” domain and the “Other, partial complete” domain were about 77 percent and 50 percent, respectively. The somewhat lower sampling rates for Panel 23 in the two “Other” domains arose due to the oversampling of veterans in that panel. With  a specified ov erall sample size of 9,700 
fewer were needed from  those assigned to  the “Other” domains  in that panel . 
Within the “noncertainty” strata (the “Other” domains) for both panels, responding NHIS households were selected for MEPS using a systematic sample selection procedure from among those eligible. The selection of the households was with probability proportionate to size (pps) where the size measure was the inverse of the NHIS initial probability of selection. The pps

================================================================================
PÁGINA 144
================================================================================

sampling was und
ertaken to help reduce the variability in the MEPS weights incurred due to the 
variability of the NHIS sampling rates.  
A note with respect to the interpretation of MEPS response rates, which are unweighted. 
Typically, sample allocations across sample domains change from one MEPS panel to another. The sample domains used may also vary by panel as is the case for Panels 23 versus Panel 24 
and Panel  25. When one compares unweighted measures (e.g., response rates) between panels 
and years, one should take into account such differences. Suppose, for example, members of one domain have a lower propensity to respond than those of another domain. Then if that domain has been allocated a higher proportion of the sample, the corresponding panel may have a lower unweighted response rate beca use of the differences in sample allocation.  
3.4 Background on Person -Level Estimation Using this MEPS Public Use 
Release  
3.4.1  Requirements to Receive a Person -level Weight  
There is a single full year person -level weight ( PERWT20F ) assigned to each recor d for each 
key, in-scope person who responded to MEPS for the full period of time that he or she was inscope during 2020. A key person is  either a member of a responding NHIS household at the 
time of interview or joined a family associated with such a household after being out- of-scope at 
the time of the NHIS (the latter circumstance includes newborns as well as those returning from military service, an institution, or residence in a foreign country). A person is inscope whenever he or she is a member of the civilian noninstitutionalized portion of the U.S. population.  
3.4.2  Details on Person -Level Weights Construction  
The person- level weight PERWT20F was developed in several stages. Initially , weights were 
developed for the Full Year 2020 Population Characteristics PUF, released a number of months earlier. Preliminary person -level weights for Panel 23, Panel 24, and Panel 25 were first created 
separately. The weighting process for each panel included adjustments for nonresponse over time and a calibration to independent population figures . Only those who were inscope on 
December  31, 2020 were raked to Current Population Survey (CPS) control totals. 
The calibration was undertaken for each panel by  raking the nonresponse adjusted weights to 
CPS population estimates based on six variables. The six variables used in the establishment of the person- level control figures were: education of the reference person (no degree, high 
school/GED no college or  some college, Bachelor’s degree or higher); census region (Northeast, 
Midwest, South, West); MSA status (MSA, non- MSA); race/ethnicity (Hispanic; Black, non -
Hispanic; Asian, non-Hispanic; and other); sex; and age. (It may be noted that, for confidentiality reasons, the MSA status variables are no longer released for public use. This started with the Full-Year 2013 Person- Level Use PUF.)  
A weight for the full sample was created by applying compositing factors to the weights associated with each panel where the factors are al l greater than 0 and sum to 1. The compositing 
 C-136 MEPS HC -224 
 


================================================================================
PÁGINA 145
================================================================================

factors for th
ese weights reflect the relative “effective sample size” of each panel, representing 
the inverse of the relative amount of variability in the individual panel estimates attributable to 
the variability of the sample weights and sample size . Using these factors helps limit the 
variability of the estimates obtained using the composited weights across the three samples pooled. 
The effective sample sizes were computed for each panel by dividing the sample size by the 
design effect associated with the variability of the nonresponse-adjusted person weights in that panel (i.e., prior to raking the weights of a panel) across the person-level respondents in the panel. The relative effective sample size was then computed by taking the ratio of the effective sample size for a panel to the sum of the effective sample sizes across the three panels.  
Using the relative nominal sample sizes (the proportions that the number of respondents in a panel represent among the total number of respondents in the three panels) as compositing factors has worked well for MEPS in previous years. However, using the re lative effective 
sample size for 2020 data increases the effectiveness of the compositing factors to limit variance to some extent in a year where the panel weights are more variable due to the higher than usual nonresponse. This approach is planned for ME PS in future years as well.  
In terms of the actual details, the individual panel weights from Panel 23 were multiplied by the factor .29, each weight from Panel 24 by the factor .36, and each weight from Panel 25 by the factor .35. Once the compositing factors were applied to produce a full- sample weight, a final 
raking was undertaken, based on the same six variables used in the raking of the individual panel weights. This weight served as the person-level weight appearing on the Full Year 2020 Population Characteristics PUF.  
The standard approach for establishing the Full Year 2020 Consolidated PUF weight from the Full Year 2020 Population Characteristics PUF is as follows. When MEPS poverty status information derived from income variables becomes available, a final raking is undertaken. The full sample weight appearing on the Population Characteristics PUF for a given year is re-raked, replacing educational attainment with poverty status while retaining the other five raking variables previously indicated. Specifically, control totals based on CPS estimates of poverty status (five categories: below poverty, from 100 to 125 percent of poverty, from 125 to 200 percent of poverty, from 200 to 400 percent of poverty, at least 400 percent of poverty) as well as age, race/ethnicity, sex, region, and MSA status were used in the weight calibration process. Only those inscope on December 31, 2020 were included in the raking process. An additional calibration step is described in Section 3.4.6. 
This standard approach was modified for the full sample weights appearing on the FY 2020 
Consolidated PUF. The raking of the Panel 23 weights was re-done as described in Section 3.4.3, and then the resulting Panel 23 weights were composited with those previously establi shed for 
Panels 24 and 25 with the same factors as described previously, producing a new full sample weight. This new weight was then raked to control figures reflecting the standard five variables plus poverty status.

3.4.3 MEPS Panel 23 Weight Developmen t Process  
The person-level weight for MEPS Panel 23 was developed using the 2019 full- year weight for 
an individual as the initially assigned weight for 2019 survey participants present in 2020. For 
key, in-scope members who joined an RU some time in 2020 after being out -of-scope in 2019, 
the initially assigned person -level weight was the corresponding 2019 family weight. The 
weighting process included an adjustment for person-level nonresponse over Rounds 6 and 7 as well as raking to population control figures for December 2020 for key, responding persons in-scope on December 31, 2020. These control totals were derived by scaling back the population distribution obtained from the March 2021 CPS to reflect the December 31, 2020 estimated population total (es timated based on Census projections for January 1, 2021). Variables used for 
person- level raking  included: education of the reference person (three categories: no degree; high 
school/GED only or some college; Bachelor’s or higher degree); Census region (Northeast, Midwest, South, West); MSA status (MSA, non- MSA); race/ethnicity (Hispanic; Black, non -
Hispanic; Asian, non-Hispanic; and other); sex; and age. The final weight for key, responding persons who were not in-scope on December 31, 2020 but were in- scope earlier in the year was 
the nonresponse-adjusted person weight without raking.  
It may be noted that for the raking variable “education of the reference person” there were four 
raking categories in prior years: no degree; high school/GED no college; som e college; and 
Bachelor's or a higher degree. However, as mentioned in the discussion of data quality issues in 2020 in Section 3.1, there was evidence that the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the years of 2020 and 2021 affected estimates associated with income and education (further details can be found in the references associated with the CPS data quality issues in 2020 and 2021 in the references section). For the full-year 2019 weights, March 2019 CPS was utilized instead of March 2020 CPS in the construction of control totals to avoid data quality issues connected to the COVID -19 pandemic. For the full- year 2020 weights, since there are no reliable education 
estimates from 2020 or 2021 CPS, a regression approach was implemented to derive education control figures. The regression approach involved two steps. The first step fit a linear regression 
model for each of the four education categories using the 2013-2018 CPS education of reference person distributions as the predictors in order to estimate the distribution for 2020, and the second step derived the education of reference person control figures by applying the estimated 2020 education distribution to the December 31, 2020 population total. The models for “no degree” and “Bachelor's or a higher degree” performed extremely well with R
2 values of 0.97 
and 0.98, respectively. The models for “high school/GED no college” and “some college” showed a lower goodness of fit, especially for some college, with a R
2 value of 0.74. A linear 
regression for the tw o categories combined improved the R2 value to 0.89, so the two levels were 
combined for the 2020 weight development. 
In developing the person-level weight for Panel 23, an additional raking dimension was included 
beyond those based on the usual six variables. This dimension was added to adjust the distribution of event-based (i.e., office- based [MV] and/or outpatient [OP]) estimates to align 
with corresponding Panel 24 weighted estimates. The table below shows ratios of weighted totals (population estimates) associated with this additional raking dimension, reflecting the extent to which the Panel 23 estimates were modified in order to correspond to Panel 24 estimates.

For
 completeness, the Panel 23 2019 full- year weight used as the initial weight for Panel 23 was 
derived from the 2018 MEPS Round 1 weight and reflected adjustment for nonresponse over the 
remaining data collection rounds in 2018 and 2019 as well as raking to the December 2018 and December 2019 population control figure s. 
3.4.4  MEPS Panel 24 Weight Development Process 
The person- level weight for MEPS Panel 24 was developed using the 2019 full -year weight for 
an individual as a “base” weight for survey participants present in 2019. For key, in- scope 
members who joined an RU some time in 2020 after being out -of-scope in 2019, the initially 
assigned person -level weight was the corresponding 2019 family weight. The weighting process 
included an adjustment for nonresponse over Rounds 4 and 5 as well as a raking to population control figures for December 2020 used for the MEPS Panel 23 weights for key, responding persons in-scope on December 31, 2020. The six standard variables employed for Panel 23 raking (education level, census region, MSA status, race/ethnicity, sex, and age) were also used for Panel 24 raking. Similar to Panel 23, the Panel 24 final weight for key, responding persons not in-scope on December 31, 2020 but in-scope earlier in the year was the nonresponse-adjusted perso n weight without raking. 
Note that the 2019 full -year weight that was used as the base weight for Panel 24 was derived as 
follows; adjustment of  the 2019 MEPS Round 1 weight for nonresponse over the remaining data 
collection rounds in 2019; and raking the resulting nonresponse adjusted weight to December 2019 population control figures. 
3.4.5  MEPS Panel 25 Weight Development Process 
The person- level weight for MEPS Panel 25 was developed using the 2020 MEPS Round 1 
person- level weight as a “base” weight. The MEPS Round 1 weights incorporated the following 
components: the original household probability of selection for the NHIS, use of a subsample of 
the NHIS panels and quarters reserved for MEPS , an adjustment for NHIS nonresponse, the 
 C-139 MEPS HC -224 
 


================================================================================
PÁGINA 148
================================================================================

probability of sel
ection for MEPS from NHIS responding households, adjustment for 
nonresponse at the dwelling unit level for Round 1, and poststratification to figures at the person 
level obtained from the March CPS of the corresponding year. For key, in- scope members  who 
joined an RU after Round 1, the Round 1 family weight served as a “base” weight.  
The weighting process also included an adjustment for nonresponse over the remaining data 
collection rounds in 2020 as well as raking to the same population control figures for December 2020 used for the MEPS Panel 23 and Panel 24 weights  for key, responding persons in-scope on 
December 31, 20 20. The six standard variables employed for Panel 23 and Panel 24 raking 
(education of the reference person, census region, MSA status, rac e/ethnicity, sex, and age) were 
also used for Panel 25 raking. The event -based raking dimension used for Panel 23 was not 
employed for Panel 25. Similar to Panel 23 and Panel 24, the Panel 25 final weight for key, responding persons who were  not in-scope on December 31, 2020 but were in-scope earlier in 
the year was the person weight after the nonresponse adjustment.  
3.4.6  The Final Person -Level Weight for 2020  
As described in Section 3.4.2, person- level weights from the three panels were then composited 
using factors identified in 3.4.2 and, for those persons inscope on December 31, raked to CPS based control totals reflecting poverty status as well as census region, MSA status, race/ethnicity, sex, and age. In addition, t he composite weights of two groups of persons who were out-of- scope 
on December 31, 2020 underwent weight calibration to adjust for expected undercoverage. Specifically, the weights  of those who were inscope sometime during the year, out-of-scope on 
December 31, and entered a nursing home during the year were poststratified to an estimate of 
the number of persons who were residents of Medicare- and Medicaid -certified nursing homes 
for part of the year (approximately 3 -9 months) during 2014. This estimate was developed from 
data on the Mini mum Data Set (MDS) of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).  
The weights of persons who died while inscope during 2020 were poststratified to corresponding estimates derived using data obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), Underlying Cause of Death, 1999-2020 on WONDER Online Database
, r
eleased in 2022, the latest available data at the time . Separate 
decedent control totals were developed for the “65 and older” and “under 65” civilian nonins
titutionalized populations. 
The sum of the person-level weights across all persons assigned a positive person- level weight, 
(i.e
., for the civilian, nonins titutionalized or in -scope population over the course of the year 
(based on PERWT20F >0) is 328,545,297 (see Table 3.2). The corresponding total for the 
population that was inscope on December 31, 2020  is 324,539,180.

3.4.7  A Note on MEPS Population Estimates  
Beginning with the 2011 Full Year data, MEPS transitioned to 2010 census-based population estimates from the CPS for poststratification and raking. CPS estimates began reflecting 2010 census -based data in 2012, and the March 2021 CPS data serve as the basis for the 2020 MEPS 
weight calibration efforts.  
Use of th e updated population controls will have a noticeable effect on estimated totals for some 
population subgroups. The article compares some 2011 CPS estimates for those aged 16 and 
older “as published” with those that would have been generated had the updated population controls been used. Among the more notable increases were for the following subgroups: those aged 55 or older (about 1.3 million more, a 1.7 percent increase); those aged 16-24 (about a half million more, a 1.4 percent increase); Blacks (400 thousand more, a 1.4 percent increase); Hispanics (1.3 million more, a 3.8 percent increase); and Asians (1.2 million more, a 10 percent increase). Corresponding changes can be anticipated for MEPS full year data beginning with the 2011 MEPS PUF. 
3.5 Coverag e 
The target population associated with this MEPS database is the 2020 U.S. civilian, noninstitutionalized population. However, the MEPS sampled households are a subsample of the NHIS households interviewed in 2017 (Panel 23), 2018 (Panel 24), and 2019 (Pa nel 25). New 
households created after the NHIS interviews for the respective panels and consisting exclusively of persons who entered the target population after 2017 (Panel 23), after 2018 (Panel 24), or after 2019 (Panel 25) are not covered by MEPS. Neither are previously out-of-scope persons who join an existing household but are unrelated to the current household residents. Persons not covered by a given MEPS panel thus include some members of the following groups: immigra nts, 
persons leaving the military, U.S. citizens returning from residence in another country, and

persons leavin

population. 
3.6 Background on Family -Level Estimation Using Th is MEPS Public Use 
File  
3.6.1  Overview  
Ther e are two family weight  variables pr ovided i n this r elease: FAMWT 20F and FAMWT 20C. 
FAMWT 20F can be  used t o make estimates f or the cross -section  of families in the  U.S. civilian 
noninstitutionalized population on December 31, 2 020 w here families ar e identified ba sed on the 
MEPS de finition  of a family uni t. Estimates c an include MEPS f amilies tha t existed a t some time 
during 2020 but whose members became out-of-scope prior to the end of the year (e.g ., all 
family me mbers moved out of the country, die d, etc.) as well as MEPS families in existence on 
December 31,  2020. FAMWT 20C can be  used t o make estimates f or the cross -section  of families 
in the U.S. civilian, noninstitutionalized population on December 31, 2020 wher e families ar e 
identified based on the CPS definition of a family unit. It may be noted that married couples, 
regardless of sex, ar e assigned to the same f amily  unit for the CPS. This represents a d efinitional 
change in family structure for the CPS with the 2020 C PS ASEC file, associated specifically with 
March, 2020.  It is reflected in MEPS starting  with the 2019 F ull Year Consolidated PUF. 
3.6.2  Definition of “Family” for Estimation Purposes  
A MEPS family generally consists of two or more persons living together in the same household 
who are related by blood, marriage, or adoption. MEPS also defines as a family unmarried persons living together who consider themselves a family unit (these are not families under the CPS definition). Single people who live with neither a relative nor a person identified as a “significant other” have also been assigned a family ID value and a family -level weight. Thus, 
they can be included or excluded from family- level estimates, as desired. Relatives identified as 
usual residents of the household who were not present at the time of the interview, such as college students living away from their parents’ home during the school year, were considered as members of the family that identified them.  
To make estimates at the family level, it is necessary to prepare a family -level file containing one 
record per family (see instructions below), family -level summary characteristics, and the family -
level weight variable ( FAMWT 20F or FAMWT 20C). Each MEPS family unit is uniquely 
identified by the combination of the variables DUID and FAMIDYR while each CPS family unit 
is uniquely identified by the combination of the variables DUID and CPSFAMID. Only persons with positive nonzero family weight values are candidates for inclusion in fa mily estimates.  
Two sets of families for whom estimates can be obtained are defined in Table 3.3 below (along with respective sample sizes). Persons with FMRS1231=1 were a member of a MEPS family on 12/31/20. The more expansive definition of families (second row in Table 3.3) includes families 
C-142 MEPS HC -224 


================================================================================
PÁGINA 151
================================================================================

and members of families who were not inscope at the end of the year. While MEPS includes 
individual persons as family units (about one- third of all units), analysts may restrict their 
analyses to families with two or more members using the famil y size variables shown in 
Table 3.3 (for example, to limit consideration to the cross- section of families with two or more 
members on December 31, 2020, analyze only families where FAMS1231 is 2 or more). Estimates can also be m ade for the cross-section of CPS families on December 31, 2020 based 
on the 12,733 sample CPS families in this data file .

3.6.3  Instructions to Create Family Estimates  
The following is a summary of the steps and the variables to be used for family- level estimation 
based on the MEPS definition of families.  
• Restrict the records of interest to those where FAMWT 20F>0 
• Concatenate the variables DUID and FAMIDYR into a new variable (e.g., DUIDFAMY).  
• To create a family -level file, sort by DUIDFAMY and then subset to one record per 
DUIDFAMY value by retaining only the reference person record (FAMRFPYR=1) for each value of DUIDFAMY. Some family -level measures needed for analytic 
purposes (e.g., means or totals) can be obtained after aggregating person- level 
information across all members of a family. For other types of measures, analysts frequently use the characteristics of the reference person to characterize his or her family u nit (e.g., the race/ethnicity, marital status, or age of the reference person).  
• Apply the weight FAMWT 20F to the analytic variable(s) of interest to obtain 
national MEPS family estimates.  
It should be noted that the MEPS families defined above include members who were out-of-scope on December 31, 20 20 although they were members of the family immediately prior to 
going out of scope for the remainder of the year. If an analyst wishes to restrict MEPS family

================================================================================

members to those who were a family member on December 31, 2020, the analyst should restrict 
family members to those with FMRS1231=1. 
The following is a summary of the steps and the variables to be used for family- level estimation 
based on the CPS definition of families.  
• Restrict the records of interest to those where FAMWT 20C>0 
• Concatenate the variables DUID and CPSFAMID into a new variable (e.g., 
DUIDFAMC).  
• To create a family -level file, sort by DUIDFAMC and then subset to one record per 
DUIDFAMC value b y retaining only the reference person record (FCRP1231=1) for 
each value of DUIDFAMC. Some family -level measures needed for analytic 
purposes (e.g., means or totals) can be obtained after aggregating person- level 
information across all members of a family.  For other types of measures, analysts 
frequently use the characteristics of the reference person to characterize his or her family unit (e.g., the race/ethnicity, marital status, or age of the reference person). (Note that to be strictly comparable to the  CPS definition of families, only those with 
two or more family members should be included in analyses.) 
• Apply the weight FAMWT 20C to the analytic variable(s) of interest to obtain 
national CPS family estimates.  
It should be noted that these CPS- families c onsist solely of those who were family members on 
December 31, 2020. 
3.6.4  Details on Family Weight Construction and Estimated Number of Families  
Because health care related decisions are influenced by a family's economic status, poverty status 
is incorporated into the poststratification component of the weighting process. However, poverty status is defined based on the CPS definition of a family, which differs from the MEPS family definition in that unmarried partners living together are considered separa te family units. Since 
data are collected in MEPS family units (RUs), prior to poststratification MEPS families in existence on December 31, 2020 containing unmarried partners living together were partitioned into units that correspond to CPS families (families with no unmarried partners are defined as family units in both MEPS and CPS). 
The process of calibrating the family weights to achieve consistency with CPS control figures 
was carried out in several steps. First, all CPS- like family units were assigned an initial family -
level weight based on the person- level weight ( PERWT20F ) of the family reference person 
(FAMRFPYR=1) of the MEPS family with which they were associated. These CPS family -level 
weights ( FAMWT 20C) were obtained by raking to population control figures derived from CPS 
estimates for December 2020 (derived by projecting  the family population totals for the March 
2020 CPS forward  to reflect December 31, 2020). In addition to poverty status, the calibration 
process for the family -level w eights incorporated the following variables: Census region; MSA 
status; race/ethnicity of reference person (Hispanic, Black but non-Hispanic, Asian, and other); 
 C-144 MEPS HC -224 
 


================================================================================
PÁGINA 153
================================================================================

family type (reference person married, living with spouse; male reference person, unmarried or 
spouse not present; female reference person, unmarried or spouse not present); age of reference person; and family size on December 31, 2020. The family -level weight variable for MEPS 
families ( FAMWT 20F) was then constructed by putting MEPS families that c onsisted of more 
than one CPS- like family back together and assigning the MEPS family -level weight based on 
the CPS family weight of the MEPS family reference person.  
The weighted population estimate for CPS families on December 31, 2020 based on 12,733 CPS families in the sample is 145,893,358. Overall, the weighted population estimate for the 12,176 MEPS family units containing at least one member of the U.S. civilian, noninstitutionalized population on December 31, 2020 (those families whose members ha ve FAMWT 20F>0 and 
FMRS1231=1) is 139,692,481. The inclusion of families whose members left the in -scope 
population prior to December 31, 2020 increases the estimated total number of families represented by the 12,290 MEPS responding families (whose members have FAMWT 20F>0) to 
140,901,035.

3.7 Analysis Using Health Insurance Eligibility Units  
To construct a weight for use in analysis using Health Insurance Eligibility Units, as identified by the variable HIEUIDX:  
1. Identify the HIEU head by your analytic intent, i.e. if only study ing health insurance 
unit with female heads of households, choose the female adult as head of household.  
2. If the weight of the HIEU head is non-zero, use the weight of the HIEU head for all members of that HIEU; or  
If the weight of the HIEU head is zero, delete the case.  
3.8 Weights and Response Rates for the Self -Administered 
Questionnaire  
For analytic purposes, a single person- level weight variable, SAQWT 20F, has been provided for 
use with the data obtained from the Self-Administered Questionnaire (SAQ). This questionnaire was administered in Panel 25 Round 2, Panel 24 Round 4, and Panel 23 Round 6 and was to be completed by each adult (person aged 18 or older) in the family. Thus, the target population for the SAQ is adults in the civilian, noninstitutionalized population at the time data were collected for Rounds 2/4/6  (generally speaking, the fall of the year in question).  
 C-145 MEPS HC -224 
 


================================================================================
PÁGINA 154
================================================================================

The final full- y
ear person -level SAQ weight for 20 20 was constructed as follows with only those 
with a 2020 full year person weight ( PERWT20F >0) eligible to receive the 2020 SAQ weight. 
The weighting process was similar to that of the full sample person -level weights: nonresponse 
adjustme nts for the weights for each panel separately; raking to CPS control totals; compositing 
the weights from the three  panels; and finally re-raking of the composited weights.  
Variables used in the nonresponse adjustment process were region, MSA status, fami ly size, 
marital status, level of education, health status, health insurance status, age, sex, and 
race/ethnicity. The weights were raked to Current Population Survey (CPS) estimates corresponding to December 2020 (the same source of control figures used f or the full year 
person weights). The variables used to form control figures (education of the reference person, region, MSA status, age, sex, and race/ethnicity) are the same variables that were used for the full year person weights. The only difference w as that age categories were developed after 
excluding ages under 18, since only adults were eligible for the SAQ.  
The final 2020 SAQ weight for this consolidated data file was then obtained by raking the 
preliminary weight to CPS estimates that were based  on poverty status (replacing education of 
the reference person) as well as the aforementioned variables. This final weight was assigned the variable name SAQWT 20F. 
In all, there were 14,473 persons assigned an SAQ weight with the sum of the weights being 252,168,275 (an estimate of the civilian, noninstitutionalized population aged 18 or older at the time the SAQ was administered).  
The Panel 23 unweighted response rate for the 2020 SAQ was 68.6 percent, t he Panel 24 
unweighted response rate for the 2020 SAQ was 61.8 percent, and the Panel 25 unweighted 
response rate for the 2020  SAQ was 60.1 percent . Pooled unweighted response rates for the 
survey respondents have been computed by taking a weighted average of the panel- specific 
response rates, where the w eights were the same factors used for the weight compositing  as 
described in Section 3.4.2 ( a value of 0.29 was associated with Panel 23, a value of 0.36 was 
associated with Panel 24, and a value of 0.35 was associated with Panel 25). The pooled unweighted response rate for the combined panels for the 2020 SAQ is 63.2 percent.  
3.9 Weights and Response Rates for the Diabetes Care Survey  
A person- level weight, DIABW 20F, was developed for use with the data obtained from the 
Diabetes Care Survey (DCS). This weight was assigned to each person aged 18 or over with an SAQ weight who completed the DCS and self-reported as having diabetes. (Although diabetes diagnosis is now asked of all ages, the DCS is only given to participants if they are 18 years of age or older.) The general weighting process was to assign each individual eligible for a DCS weight the SAQ expenditure weight as the initial weight. This weight was adjusted to compensate for RU level nonresponse to the question as to whether or not each RU member had diabetes and then for nonresponse among those receiving the DCS questionnaire.  
Prior to Panel 12, the identification of people eligible to receive the DCS quest ionnaire was 
focused on the Rounds 3/5 interview. During the Rounds 3/5 regular MEPS interview, each RU 
 C-146 MEPS HC -224 
 


================================================================================
PÁGINA 155
================================================================================

respondent was a
sked to complete a “conditions” question to identify all 
current/deceased/institutionalized RU members of any age who had been diagnosed with 
diabetes. Each RU member who was identified as having diabetes by the RU respondent was then eligible to receive the DCS questionnaire. To determine which DCS respondents actually had diabetes (and thus were members of the target population), each DCS respondent was asked if s/he was told by a physician that s/he had diabetes. While the DCS questionnaire has been distributed to persons under the age of 18, the constructed DCS variables released in the person-level PUF apply only to adults. Beginning i n Panel 12, a different screening process has been 
employed to identify those eligible to receive the DCS questionnaire. This process, described next,  involves asking screener questions in each round, with  the group of persons about whom 
these questions are asked varying  from round to round.  
In Round 1, the RU respondent is asked to identify all RU members (including those who went out of scope unless they died prior to the date of interview) with diabetes. In Rounds 2/4/6 , the 
same screening information i s gathered but only for new RU members (as long as they did not 
die during the round). In Round 3, Round 5, and Round 7 the screening questions are asked of the RU respondent for all RU members who were: (a) inscope sometime during the round but had not died prior to the date of interview; and (b) had not been identified as having diabetes in a previous round (this includes people with missing data, classified as not having diabetes in all previous rounds of MEPS, and all new members of the RU in Round 3, Round 5, or Round 7). Any RU member who has been identified by the RU respondent as having diabetes at any time during MEPS will be asked to complete a DCS questionnaire. This process has been designed to help ensure that all RU members with diabetes will b e given a DCS questionnaire to complete. 
Note that only those 18 years or older were asked to complete a DCS questionnaire. 
In all, 1,581 people were assigned a DCS weight ( DIABW 20F>0). The sum of the DCS weights 
is 28,125,425, an estimate of the adult population self -reporting as having been diagnosed with 
diabetes based on the two -step process described above.  
The Panel 23 unweighted response rate for the 2020 DCS was 63.7 percent. The Panel 24 
unweighted response rate for the 2020 DCS was 55.4 percent. The Panel 25 unweighted response rate for the 20 DCS was 53.4 percent. The pooled unweighted response rate, calculated based on 
applying the compositing factors described in Section 3.4.2, for the combined panels for the DCS is 57.1 percent .  
3.10  Variance  Estimation  
The MEPS is based on a complex sample design. To obtain estimates of variability (such as the standard error of sample estimates or corresponding confidence intervals) for MEPS estimates, analysts need to take into account the complex sample design of MEPS for both person- level and 
family -level analyses. Several methodologies have been developed for estimating standard errors 
for surveys with a complex sample design, including the Taylor- series linearization method, 
balanced repeated replication , and jackknife replication. Various software packages provide 
analysts with the capability of implementing these methodologies. MEPS analysts most commonly use the Taylor Series approach. Although this data file does not contain replicate weights, the capability of employing replicate weights constructed using the Balanced Repeated 
 C-147 MEPS HC -224 
 


================================================================================
PÁGINA 156
================================================================================

Replication (B
RR) methodology is also provided if needed to develop variances for more 
complex estimators (see S ection 3.10.2). 
3.10.1  Taylor -series Linearization Method  
The variables needed to calculate appropriate standard errors based on the Taylor -series 
linearization method are included on this and all other MEPS public use files. Software packages 
that permit the use of the Taylor -series linearization method include SUDAAN, R, Stata, SAS 
(version 8.2 and higher), and SPSS (version 12.0 and higher). For complete information on the capabilities of a package, analysts should refer to the corresponding software user documentation.  
Using the Taylor -series linearization method, v ariance estimation strata and the variance 
estimation PSUs within these strata must be specified. The variables VARSTR and VARPSU on 
this MEPS data file serve to identify the sampling strata and primary sampling units required by the variance estimation pr ograms. Specifying a “with replacement” design in one of the 
previously mentioned computer software packages will provide estimated standard errors appropriate for assessing the variability of MEPS survey estimates. It should be noted that the number of de grees of freedom associated with estimates of variability indicated by such a 
package may not appropriately reflect the number available. For variables of interest distributed throughout the country (and thus the MEPS sample PSUs), one can generally expect to have at least 100 degrees of freedom associated with the estimated standard errors for national estimates based on this MEPS database. 
Prior to 2002, MEPS variance strata and PSUs were developed independently from year to year, 
and the last two characters of the strata and PSU variable names denoted the year. Beginning 
with the 2002 Point- in-Time PUF, the approach changed with the intention that variance strata 
and PSUs would be developed to be compatible with all future PUFs until the NHIS design changed.  Thus, when pooling data across years 2002 through the Panel 11 component of the 
2007 files, the variance strata and PSU variables provided can be used without modification for variance estimation purposes for estimates covering multiple years of data. There were 203 variance estimation strata, each stratum with either two or three variance estimation PSUs.  
From Panel 12 of the 2007 files, a new set of variance strata and PSUs were developed because of the introduction of a new NHIS design. There are 165 variance strata with either two or three variance estimation PSUs per stratum starting from Panel 12. Therefore, there are a total of 368 (203+165) variance strata in the 2007 Full Year file as it consists of two panels that were selected under two independent NHIS sample designs. Since both MEPS panels in the Full Year files from 2008 through 2016 were based on the next NHIS design, there are only 165 variance strata. These variance strata (VARSTR values) have been numbered from 1001 to 1165 so that they can be readily distinguished from those developed under the former NHIS sample design in the event that data are pooled for several years.  
As discussed, a complete change was made to the NHIS sample design in 2016, effectively changing the MEPS design beginning with calendar year 2017. There were 117 variance strata originally formed under this new design intended for use until the next fully new NHIS design

was implemented. In order to make the pooling of data across multiple years of MEPS more 
straightfo rward, the numbering system for the variance strata has changed. Those strata 
associated with the new design (implemented in 2016) were numbered from 2001 to 2117. 
However, the new NHIS sample design implemented in 2016 was further modified in 2018. With 
the modification in the 2018 NHIS sample design, the MEPS variance structure for the 2019 Full Year file has also had to be modified, reducing the number of variance strata to 105. Consistency was maintained with the prior structure in that the 2019 Full Ye ar file variance strata were also 
numbered within the range of values from 2001-2117, although there are now gaps in the values assigned within this range. Due to the modification, each stratum could contain up to five variance estimation PSUs.  
Some analys ts may be interested in pooling data across multiple years of MEPS data. As noted 
on the cover page of this document, due to data quality issues arising from collecting data during the COVID -19 pandemic in 2020, caution should be taken when interpreting the results of such 
pooling. 
If pooling across years  is to be undertaken, it should be noted that, to obtain appropriate standard 
errors when doing so, it is necessary to specify a common variance structure. Prior to 2002, each 
annual MEPS public use file wa s released with a variance structure unique to the particular 
MEPS sample in that year. Starting in 2002, the annual MEPS public use files were released with a common variance structure that allowed users to pool data from 2002 through 2018. However, with the need to modify the variance structure beginning with 2019, this can no longer be routinely done. 
To ensure that variance strata are identified appropriately for variance estimation purposes when 
pooling MEPS data across several years, one can proceed as follows: 
1. When pooling any years between  2002 through 2018, use the variance strata 
numbering as is.  
2. When pooling (a) any year from 1996 to 2001 with any year from 2002 or later, or 
(b) the year 2019 and beyond with any earlier year, use the pooled linkage public use 
file HC-036 that contains the proper variance structure. The HC -036 file is updated 
every year so that appropriate variance structures are available with pooled data.  
Further details on the HC-036 file can be found in the public use documentation of the HC -036 file. 
3.10.2  Balanced Repeated Replication (BRR) Method  
BRR replicate weights are not provided on this MEPS PUF for the purposes of variance estimation. However, a file containing a BRR replication structure is made  available so that the 
users can form replicate weights, if desired, from the final MEPS weight to compute variances of MEPS estimates using either BRR or Fay’s modified BRR (Fay 1989) methods. The replicate weights are useful to compute variances of complex non- linear estimators for which a Taylor 
linear form is not easy to derive and not available in commonly used software. For instance, it is not possible to calculate the variances of a median or the ratio of two medians using the Taylor

================================================================================

linearization me tho
d. For these types of estimators, users may calculate a variance using BRR or 
Fay’s modified BRR methods. However, it should be noted that the replicate weights have been 
derived from the final weight through a shortcut approach. Specifically, the repli cate weights are 
not computed starting with the base weight and all adjustments made in different stages of weighting are not applied independently in each replicate. Thus, the variances computed using this one- step BRR do not capture the effects of all weighting adjustments that would be captured 
in a set of fully developed BRR replicate weights. The Taylor Series approach does not fully capture the effects of the different weighting adjustments either.  
The dataset HC -036BRR, MEPS 1996-2018 Replicates for Variance Estimation File, contains 
the information necessary to construct the BRR replicates. It contains a set of 128 flags (BRR1-BRR128) in the form of half sample indicators, each of which is coded 0 or 1 to indicate whether the person should or should not be included in that particular replicate. These flags can be used in conjunction with the full-year weight to construct the BRR replicate weights. For analysis of MEPS data pooled across years, the BRR replicates can be formed in the same way using the HC-036, MEPS 1996-2018 Pooled Linkage Variance Estimation File. For more information 
about creating BRR replicates, users can refer to the documentation for the HC -036BRR pooled 
linkage file

3.11  Guidelines for Determining which Weight to Use for Analyses 
Involving Data/Variables from Multiple Sources and Supplements: 
MEPS 2020 Full-Year Use File  
Which weight variable to use is decided based on a hierarchy .  
For person-level analyses not involving variables from the SAQ or DCS, PERWT20F should always be used.  
For person-level analysis involving variables from the SAQ but not the DCS, the SAQWT20F 
should be used. For example, if examining access to care or quality of care variables from the SAQ by socio -demographics, health status, or health insurance status, SAQWT20F is the 
appropriate weight even though person- level socio -demographic, health status, and health 
insurance status variables are part of the core person -level questionnaire. Whenever data from 
the Diabetes Care Survey (DCS) are used, alone or in conjunction with data from other questionnaires, the weight variable DIABW20F should be used for those eligible to provide DCS data.  
For all family -level  analyses, FAMWT 20F or FAMWT 20C should be used. 
3.12  Using MEPS Data for Trend Analysis  
First, of course, we note that there are uncertainties associated with 2020 data quality for reasons discussed earlier in Section 3.1. Evaluations described in that section suggest that care should be taken in the interpretation of estimates based on data collected in 2020 as well as in comparisons over time. Trend analyses are challenging since the advent of the COVID -19 pandemic resulted

================================================================================

in uncertain data qu
ality for M EPS as well as standard benchmark sources such as the CPS, 
ACS, and NHIS while the pandemic also had an impact on the health and access to health care of 
the U.S. population. For such reasons, the extent to which 2020 health care parameters may differ from  those of prior years is difficult to assess. 
In terms of other factors to be aware of, MEPS began in 1996, and the utility of the survey for analyzing health care trends expands with each additional year of data; however, it is important to consider a var iety of factors  when examining trends over time using MEPS. The length of 
time being analyzed should also be considered. In particular, large shifts in survey estimates over 
short periods of time (e.g. from one year to the next) that are statistically sign ificant should be 
interpreted with caution unless they are attributable to known factors such as changes in public policy, economic conditions, or MEPS survey methodology. 
With respect to methodological considerations, in 2013 MEPS introduced an effort foc used on 
field procedure changes such as interviewer training  to obtain more complete information about 
health care utilization from MEPS respondents with full implementation in 2014. This effort 
likely resulted in improved data quality and a reduction in underreporting starting in the  second 
half of 2013 and throughout the 2014 full year files and have had some impact on analyses involving trends in utilization across years.  
The aforementioned change in the NHIS sample design in 2016 could also potentially affect 
trend analyses. The new NHIS sample design is based on more up- to-date information related to 
the distribution of housing units across the U.S. As a result, it can be expected to better cover the full U.S. civilian, noninstitutionalized population, the target population for MEPS, as well as many of its subpopulations. Better coverage of the target population helps to reduce the potential for bias in both NHIS and MEPS estimates. 
Another change with the potential to affect trend analysis involved maj or modifications t
 o the 
MEPS instrument design and data collection process , particularly in the events section s of the 
instrument. These were introduced in the Spring of 2018 and thus affected data beginning with 
Round 1 of Panel 23, Round 3 of Panel 22, and Round 5 of Panel 21. Since the Full Year 2017 PUFs were established from data collected in Rounds 1 -3 of Panel 22 and Rounds 3-5 of 
Panel  21, they reflected two different instrument designs. In order to mitigate the effect of such 
differences within the  same full year file, the Panel 22 Round 3 data and the Panel 21 Round 5 
data were transformed to make them as consistent as possible with data collected under the previous design. The changes in the instrument were designed to make the data collection eff ort 
more efficient and easy to administer . In addition, expectations were that data on some items, 
such as those related to health care events, would be more complete with the potential of identifying more events. Increases in service use reported since th e implementation of these 
changes are consistent with these expectations. Data users should be aware of possible 
impacts on the data and especially trend analysis for these data years due to the design 
transition.  
Process changes, such as data editing and imputation, may also affect trend analyses. For example, users should refe r to Section 2.5.11 above and, for more detail, the documentation for 
the prescription drug file (HC-220A) when analyzing prescription drug spending over time.  
 C-151 MEPS HC -224

PÁGINA 160
================================================================================

As always,
 it is reco mmended that data users review relevant sections of the documentation for 
descriptions of these types of changes that might affect the interpretation of changes over time 
before undertaking trend analyses.  
Analysts may also wish to consider using statistic al techniques to smooth or stabilize analyses of 
trends using MEPS data such as comparing pooled time periods (e.g. 1996-1997 versus 2011-2012), working with moving averages, or using modeling techniques with several consecutive years of MEPS data to test the fit of specified patterns over time.  
Finally, statistical significance tests should be conducted to assess the likelihood that observed 
trends are not attributable to sampling variation. In addition, researchers should be aware of the impact of multip le comparisons on Type I error. Without making appropriate allowance for 
multiple comparisons, undertaking numerous statistical significance tests of trends increases the likelihood of concluding that a change has taken place when one has not.

______________________________
* The survey questions corresponding to the variables ADKALC42 
   and ADOFTALC42 changed from 2018 to 2020. In the 2018 Full-
   Year Consolidated file, the variable ADKALC42 was based on the 
   survey question: “In the last 12 months, has a doctor, nurse, or 
   other health care professional asked you how much and how  often you drink  alcohol?” In  the 2020 Full-Year Consolidated file, a different variable,  
   ADOFTALC42, reflects this same  question,  while ADKALC42 is based on a new question: “How often do you have a drink containing alcohol?” 
   Users should be mindful of this change when utilizing the variable ADKALC42 in their analyse s for 2018, 2020, and beyond.*

Appendix 4 
Modification of Employment and Health Insurance Variables for Panel 23  
Overview  
Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on MEPS collection methods and lower response 
rates in the 2020 calendar year, AHRQ extended fielding for Panel 23 persons to include two additional rounds, Round 6 and Round 7, that collected information about 2020. As a result, 2020 MEPS includes three panels of data, Panel 25 Rounds 1, 2, and 3, Panel 24 Rounds 3, 4, and 5, and Panel 23 Rounds 6 and 7.  
The decision to extend Panel 23 to include additional rounds occurred after Panel 23 Round 5 
was fielded.  As a result, Round 5 was fielded as a traditional terminal round where questions are 
asked of respondents as of 12/31/2019. Had the decision been made much earlier, Round 5 would have been fielded as a cross -year round (similar to Round 3), where questions would have 
covered the events through 2020 up to the Round 5 interview date. Given this impromptu design decision, in order to capture data after 12/31/2019, the Panel 23 Round 6 reference period began on January 1, 2020 (not the Round 5 interview date) and ended anywhere from July through mid -
December  2020. The reference period f or Round 6 averaged 9 months, ranging from 7 months to 
just over 11 months, and exceeds a standard round length. 
In an effort to make the Panel 23 employment and health insurance variables comparable to the 
data from prior years, a decision was made to use the data collected in Round 6, along with data reported in prior rounds, to separately identify employment or health insurance characteristics that occurred over two time periods - the period from 1/1/2020 to the Round 5 interview date, and the period from the Round 5 interview date to the end of Round 6. In general, data after the Round 5 interview date and prior to the end of Round 6 is stored in the ‘42’ variables. Similarly, data from 1/1/2020 (or later) up to the Round 5 interview date is stored in the ‘31’ variables for Panel 23. Note that sometimes ‘ 31’ variables also include the portion of Panel 23 Round 5 that 
occurred between the Round 4 interview and 12/31/2019. Additional details for specific variable groups are given below.  
There are two groups of decedents from Panel 23 on this file who passed away in Round 6. Both 
groups have PSTATS31=PSTATS42=31. The first group comprises persons with applicable values (not -1) for both the ‘31’ and ‘42’ variables. They passed away between the Round 5 and Round 6 interviews. For this group, data users may wish to recode PSTATS31=11. The second group comprises persons who passed away in 2020 before their RUs’ Round 5 interviews. They have employment and insurance ‘42’ variables = -1 (inapplicable) and applicabl e values (that is, 
not -1) for the ‘31’ variables. For this group, data users may wish to set some additional ‘42’ variables, such as PSTAT42 and AGE42X, to -1.

Special 2020 Panel 23 Round 6 Employment Data 
Processing  
Developing 2020 Employment Informat ion 
In order to create consistency in employment measures over time, AHRQ requested that job 
rosters and employment status be adjusted for FY 2020 public use files so that (a) Round 5 would represent employment for the time period between 1/1/2020 and the Round 5 interview date and ( b) Round 6 would represent employment for the time period between the Round 5 
interview date and the Round 6 interview date.  
The adjustment lengthens Round 5 to resemble a standard Round 3 cross- year reference period 
and shortens Round 6 to resemble a standard Round 4 field period. 
Persons Eligible for Job Roster Adjustment  
Any person who was part of a household in Round 6 and who had one or more Round 6 jobs that 
began or ended between January 1, 2020 and the Round 5 interview date was eligible for adjustment.  
Number of Jobs and Persons Involved in Special Processing 
Job rosters for 610 persons were evaluated for adjustment. These persons had 711 job records whose start and/or stop date was on or before the Round 5 interview date. Some persons had more than one job flagged for review. Of the 610 persons, 188 persons (with 289 job records)

================================================================================

either had multiple jobs requiring adjustment or complex Round 5 and Round 6 rosters. They 
include persons with multiple miscellaneous jobs or multiple former jobs in addition to jobs requiring adjustment. These rosters were evaluated and adjusted by experienced Employment section instrument analysts (described below). The remaining 422 job records were programmatically adjusted based on how jobs are allowed to be reported in CAPI flow.  
Required Adjustments  
Job Roster Adjustments  
The following describes rules for selecting a job for adjustment and the typical  roster 
adjustment made: 
1. New Panel 23 Round 6 current main job or current miscellaneous jobs where  
a. the job start year is 2020, the job start month is positive and is less than the Round 5 interview month or  
b. the job start year is 2020 and the job start month the same as the Round 5 interview month and the day is the same as or less than the Round 5 interview day (including unknown values) or  
c. the job started before 2020 
Roster adjustment : a new Round 5 job was created from the Round 6 job 
and the Round 6 job became a reviewed job. In some cases, a new Round 6 job became a new Round 5 miscellaneous job that changed to a main job in Round 6.  
2. New Panel 23 Round 6 former main job and former miscellaneous jobs where  
a. the job stop year is 2020, the stop month is positive, and the job stop month is less than the Round 5 interview month or  
b. the job stop year is 2020, the job stop month is the same as the Round 5 interview month and the job stop day is the same as or less than the Round 5 interview day (including unknown values)  
c. the job stop year is positive and less than 2020 
d. the job start year is 20 20, the job start month is positive and is less 
than the Round 5 interview month or

e. the job start year is 2020 and the job start month the same as the 
Round 5 interview month and the day is the same as or less than the Round 5 interview day (including unknown values) or  
f. the job started before 2020 
Roster adjustment : either a new former Round 5 job was created from the 
Round 6 job and the Round 6 job was deleted or an existing Round 5 job became a former job and the Round 6 job was deleted. For some cases, a 
new Round 5 current main job was created and the Round 6 job became a reviewed job that ends in Round 6. In cases where a new Round 6 former main job could not be adjusted as the Round 5 current main job because a Round 5 current main job existed, the Round 6 job was retained as reported. No editing was performed in order to retain the more detailed information reported on a former main job. 
3. New Panel 23 Round 6 last job outside of reference period job or retirement jobs reported at EM380 where  
a. the job stop year is 2020, the stop month is positive, and the job stop month is less than the Round 5 interview month or  
b. the job stop year is 2020, the job stop month is the same as the Round 5 interview month and the job stop day is the same as or less than the Round 5 interview day (including unknown values) 
c. the job stop year is positive and less than 2020  
Roster adjustment : the Round 6 job became a Round 5 last job outside of 
reference period or retirement job. If a retirement job at the same establishment wa s reported in Round 5, no editing was performed and the 
Round 6 job was retained. 
4. Reviewed Panel 23 Round 5 main or miscellaneous jobs that end in Round 6 where  
a. the job stop year is 2020, the stop month is positive, and the job stop month is less than the Round 5 interview month or  
b. the job stop year is 2020, the job stop month is the same as the Round 5 interview month and the job stop day is the same as or less than the Round 5 interview day  
c. the job stop year is positive and less than 2020 
Roster adjustment : the Round 5 current job became a Round 5 former job 
and the Round 6 job was deleted.

In some cases, Round 7 job-level variables, such as CREATEQ, ORIGRND, and 
TYPECHGD, required adjustment.  
Person -Level Adjustments  
Employment variables rely on other person variables. Internal use versions of administrative variables, INSCOP31 and INSCOP42, and demographic variables, AGE31X and AGE42X, were specially recalculated for use in this process.  
Scope 
Scope is used in Employment variable construction to determine household status between Round 4 and Round 5 interview dates and Round 5 and Round 6 interview dates. For Employment purposes, situations of concern were those where (a) a person had a job in Round 5 but left the RU in Round 6 or (b) a person was not present in Round 5 but was part of the Round 6 interview. 
For the first group (a), a person maintained their “in scope” status during adjustment so that 
Round 5 employment status (EMPST31) reflected employment activity in both calendar years consistent with a second panel Round 3 person whose reference period crosses over from one calendar year into the next. Maintaining an ‘in scope’ status enabled complete setting of EMPST31 for persons where the following is true: 
• Round 5 person has no Round 6 interview 
• Person has a Round 5 job that ends in the 2019 portion of Round 5 
• Person has no Round 5 job but is present in the household at any time between the 
1/1/20 and the Round 5 interview date 
Persons in the latter group (b) began participation with MEPS in Round 6, so there was no 
Round 5 data. Therefore, scope was adjusted for these persons during the adjustment process. These persons were set to either:  
• ‘3’, meaning person is not in scope at the start of RU reference period, but is in scope at the end of the RU reference period. (For example, the person is in scope from the date the person joined the RU or the person was in the military in the previous round, but is no longer in the military in the current round) or 
• ‘5’, meaning person is out-of-scope for all of the reference period during which he or she is an RU member. (For example, the person is in the military)  
With either setting, per existing Employment variable logic, a person’s Round 5 employment status, EMPST31, can be derived and Employment varia bles can reflect employment activity.  
The following two tables summarize the extent of person- level recalculations of scope:

mployment variables were constructed for the following groups of persons who had no 
previous 2019 Round 5 Employment information: 
1. There were 142 persons who were 16 or older that became in scope for Round 5 and 
became eligible to have Employment variables constructed in 2020. This means that Round 5 settings in 2019 Population Characteristics public use release will differ from Round 5 settings in 2020 Population Characteristics public use release. Note that not all persons had a job requiring adjustment. 
2. There were an additional 55 persons with a job flagged for adjustment who joined a household in Round 6 between January 1, 2020 and the Round 5 interview. In addition to including the new Round 5 job in the 2020 Jobs File, R31 Employment variables will reflect some form of employment. These persons do not appear in 2019 Population Characteristics public use release. 
Age 
An internal version of AGE31X was calculated based on the Round 5 interview date instead of 12/31/19. Twenty three persons had their age change from 15 to 16 and nine had a job requiring adjustment, two of which were current main jobs.  
Variable Constructi on Adjustments  
Once jobs were adjusted to reflect whether they occurred in Round 5 and/or Round 6, ‘31’ and ‘42’ variables identifying the current main job characteristics were constructed for the FY Population Characteristics  file.

Not all person-round level data required for development of Employment variables could be 
adjusted. Consequently, variable logic was modified to use both Round 5 and Round 6 in variable development. These variables were EMPSTrr, HELDrrX, OFFERrrX, and DISVWrrX.  
1. EMPST31 relied on Round 6 data before using Round 5 data. EMPST31 set to ‘Employed at R5 Interview Date (2), ‘Not Employed During R5’ (4), and ‘Cannot Be Computed’ (-15) were highly reliant on Round 6 information. In addition, EMPST31 was constructed without differentiati ng ‘-7’ and ‘- 8’ from -15 since dependent 
variables treat these values the same.  
2. Logic for standard versions of HELD31X and HELD42X was replicated by creating a series of summary insurance variables. If a Round 5 current main job was created from a Round 6 job, insurance status from Round 6 is reflected in HELD31X. Otherwise, insurance status on HELD31X and HELD42X reflects responses from the interview in the round. 
3. Logic on the variables OFFER31X and OFFER42X first sets persons to ‘1’, ‘2’, ‘- 7’, 
or ‘-8’. For the adjustment process, remaining persons were set to ‘-15’ in a single 
logical block, instead of at one of several CAPI- specific logical blocks where records 
are set to ‘ -15.’ 
4. Like HELD31X and HELD42X, variable logic for DISVW31X and DISVW42X used specially constructed -summary insurance variables and, for DISVW31X, relied 
on Round 6 insurance settings before deferring to Round 5 settings.

Modification of Standard MEPS Health Insurance Variables 
for Panel 23  
• “At interview date”  variables (exclusive of Medicare):  The “at interview date” 31 
variables (for example, GOVTA31)  contain  a person’s coverage status as of the 
Round 5 interview date; t he “at interview date” 42 variables (for example, 
GOVTA42) contain coverage status as of the Round 6 interview date.  
• “At any time” variables (exclusive of Medicare):  The “at any time” variables  only 
consider ed coverage status for the months from January (or later)  up to and including 
the Round 5 interview date for 31 variables (for example, GOVAAT31) , and the 
months from the Round 5 interview date up and including to the end of the Round 6 
interview date for the 42 variables (for example, GOVAAT42). 
• HMO and Tricare Plan variables:  The values of these round- specific  variables 
also reflect the division of Round 6 between the 31 and 42 variables based on the coverage variables that were modified as described above, so no additional modification of these variables was  necessary.  
• Month by month variables, insurance coverage, previous insurance coverage, ever insured, reported premium: No change was made. 
• Medical bills variables:  The medical bills variables are based on CAPI data that are 
not associated with a monthly time period, so no adjust ment to  these variables was 
made. 
• FSA variables:  The FSA variables are normally set based on the first round of the 
panel for that year, usually Round 1 or Round 3, depending on the panel. Since neither R ound 1 nor Round 3 data were collected for  Panel 23  in 2020, all FSA 
variables for the panel were set to -1.  
• Verification:  The 31 verification round flag was set to 5 if Round 6 coverage existed  
between 1/1/2020 and the Round 5 interview date and the report of coverage occurred in the verification module. Thus, the variable VERFLG31 is  restricted to
